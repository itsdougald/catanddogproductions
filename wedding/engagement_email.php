	<p>
	On Sunday 16th July @ 2am Dougal something special happened in Melbourne at the Langham Hotel...
	</p>
	I proposed to Vicky aka Lady V and with no hesitation she replied yes!
	<p>
	So there we have it, she's now an offical lady and engaged to be my wife...
	</p>
	<p>
	Fair dinkum.
	</p>
	<p>
	Look forward to seeing you all in November for our flying visit.
	</p>
	<p>
	Cheers,<br>
	Dougs<br>

	Lowenbrau pub last night celebrating my Birthday and engagement with friends.
	Also, me winning a Stein drinking competition last night; beating a big Sotsman and a local Sydneysider - I knew I had a talent!
