	<h2>Pre-Wedding</h2>
	<p>
	Since <a href="engagement.php">proposing</a> we've coordinated with Cats family back in the UK
	and now have an official wedding date of <strong>Friday 11th May 2007</strong>. An announcement was also published in
	the UK Telegraph which we have scanned in and can be viewed <a href="<?php echo $EXETEL_HOME ?>/media/NSG_VCSEngage1.rtf">here</a>.</p>
	<p>
	The church service will take place at St.Peter and Pauls Cathederal in Fareham, Hampshire. Our reception will 
	be held at the <a href="http://www.royalmarinesmuseum.co.uk/corporate_mountbatten.htm" target="new">Royal Marine Museum</a> 
	in the Mountbatten room, holding up to 120 seated guests and 180 standing. We're currently
	going through the mass amounts of planning (Well Clive and Lynda are), invites and finer details for the big day. Anyway make sure 
	check out our website which will keep you all posted!
	</p>

	<h2>Wedding Day</h2>

	<p>
	The wedding day felt like it started on Thursday 10th May, with guest arriving at <a href="http://www.royalbeachhotel.co.uk/" target="new">The Royal Beach Hotel</a> 
	on Portsmouth's Eastney seaside front. Vicky and her family also managed to pop over to the Hotel bar for a few drinks. The night was such a great start to our wedding extravaganza!
	</p>

	The wedding day went without a glitch, through strict regimented tasks mapped out by the Ex-Commander, it was hardly surprising! We had 119 guests down for the day and wedding 
	breakfast and a further 40 guests for the evening. The weather was glorious the whole two weeks we were in the UK prior to the wedding. On the wedding day it was bright but did

	rain during our transferrence from the Church to The Royal Marine Museum (RMM). Fortunately it did stop halfway through our photo shoot outside RMM, so we got some great shots with the Royals Royce (including the Queen Mums!) parked outside. </p>
	<p>
	Vicky arrived at the Church 3 minutes early (can you believe it!!) but with photos to be taken she bounced down the aisle, on time, with the biggest smile in the world! I was overwhelmed. 
	<a href="<?php echo $EXETEL_HOME_WEDDING ?>/07.Wedding.Fri.11.May.2007/index.html" title="Newly wedded Bride and Groom!" target="new"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1180/531105180_761230a8db_m.jpg" width="180" height="240" alt="Dougal &amp; Vicky" align="right" /></a>
	Initially not feeling too nervous until "The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba" was sounded the butterflies and soaring emotions kicked in! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Father Tony did a great job of the service, also intertwining the moving readings read by Eva and Kim made it very personable. Once we signed the registration book we were now officially Mr &amp; Mrs N Guppy aka Mr &amp; Mrs Dougal Guppy or inline with this website Mr &amp; Mrs Cat and Dog Guppy!!.  
	</p>
	<p>
	With the bulk of the photos, taken by our official photographer Roger Eldridge, were outside the Church - he knew the weather was deteriorating. <a href="index.php?#Photos">See below</a> for links to photos.
	</p>

	Due to the rain, pre-wedding breakfast drinks were held in the Medal Room of RMM. With a quick drink for Mr &amp; Mrs Guppy we headed down the stairs and the guest followed for a planned group photo. With a brief chat after to guests walking down the stairs into the Mountbatten room it was time for food, wine and Champagne!! 
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>
	<a href="<?php echo $EXETEL_HOME_WEDDING ?>/07.Wedding.Fri.11.May.2007/index.html" title="Outside the Royal Marine Museum" target="new"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1204/532617523_a0cdea4d5e_m.jpg" width="240" height="192" alt="Royal Marine Museum" align="right"/></a>
	Falling behind schedule, slighlty, we cut the cake at 7.15pm (instead of 7pm) and the speeches started at 7.30pm. With officially only 15 minutes left before the first dance, this was obviously not feasible - espeicially since the two dads, myself and best man Jim Jam had a lot to say! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Luckily everyone had enough food in the stomachs before the next feed the guests were ready for a lecture in the life of Vicky and Dougal.
	<a href="<?php echo $EXETEL_HOME_WEDDING ?>/07.Wedding.Fri.11.May.2007/index.html" title="Cutting the Cake" target="new"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1185/531227658_4e90a6f75f_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Cutting the cake" align="left"/></a>
	</p>
	By 8.30pm the first dance was played - "We have all the time in the world" by Louis Armstrong, and the nine piece Royal Marine band kicked in after
	and the partying began!!! They were absolutely fantastic - the dance floor was covered for nearly the rest of the night (except for when they had a brief break)! Steve the magician also played his part to 
	the guests and was exceptional - in fact he was only hired for an hour but wanted to stay and enjoy the fun!
	</p>
	<p>
	<a href="<?php echo $EXETEL_HOME_WEDDING ?>/07.Wedding.Fri.11.May.2007/index.html" title="First Dance"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1085/531337801_044e79324e_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="First Dance" align="right"/></a>
	By 11.30pm the reception time had run out but with a coach at the ready, we were shipped back to the Hotel for further drinking! The hotel bar was buzzing and continued to buzz 
	till at least 5am. Once the bar bell for closure sounded Dougal swept his wife off her feet and took her to our newly revised Bridal suite (with a double bed and not two twins as previously setup!) and signed and sealed the deal, wahooooooo!!! <br/>

	In the mean time BBC Three took a close following in the lead up to our wedding day and recently released a sitcom from it called "Gavin and Stacey" (they had to rename us for legal reasons!!) - have a read about the series <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/programmes/gavinandstacey/episodes.shtml">here</a>

	Setting up a gift list fund with trailfinders.com and family, and friends donating generously, we were lucky enough to have a honeymoon in Italy for two weeks (...and we're planning to have another one)! With a well earned rest we flew with easyjet on Sat 12th May 2007, 
	the following day after our wedding. The food and attractions were absolutely fantastic and just 
	got better and better as our honeymoon transpired!!! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Steeped in a messy history there was so much to see - we paced ourselves well but always centred our days around three magnificant feeds a day - boy what a life...
	We took plenty of photos so follow the links below for a breakdown of our honeymoon trip.

	<p><strong>FAME REMEMBER OUR NAME!....</strong><br /> 
	We were recently featured in Portsmouth's local newspaper - with a 40 page wedding supplement we had one page on how we organised a wedding
	from the other side of the world. We answered a string of question emailed by a local reporter to which we answered in detail and directed her to the infamous
	cat and dog productions website! Anyway check out the the <a href="catanddogweddingfame.pdf" target="new">article</a> to what really was a perfect day...
