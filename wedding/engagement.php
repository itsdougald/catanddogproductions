	Proposing to Vicky Claire Smith on <strong>Sunday 16th July 2006 2am</strong>, Room 301 at 
	<a href="http://melbourne.langhamhotels.com/" target="new">The Langham Hotel</a> situated
	on the Southbank, she accepted with the reply "yes little doggy!". 
	</p>
	<p>The weekend was magical.</p>
	<p>
	We had two nights at the 5 star hotel, shopping, eating, drinking and lots of gambling! Click either

	<a name="parties">Returning</a> on <strong>Sunday 16th July</strong>, late afternoon, we had the following night out booked at the <a href="http://www.lowenbrau.com.au/" target="new">Löwenbräu Keller</a> 
	in The Rocks, Sydney. We broke the news to everyone who turned up. With a night
	of drinking Bavarian beer, feasting on pork knuckle, me winning a Stein drinking comp
	and our first dance warm up, it was a great night out!

	<a name="engagement_party_2">We</a> had our second engagemnt party on <strong>Friday 1st September</strong> at <a href="http://www.verandah.com.au/">Verandah bar</a>
	in the hub of Sydney's CBD!	With a space hired out we had around 40 friends from all walks of life who came along.
	A massive thank you for the money and presents you bought us; it really was a massive surprise and didn't expect this at all! The night went really well.
	Well, from what I can remember, as by 2am the barman refused to serve me anymore drinks. I think it may have been the accidental smashing
	of a few schooner glasses that may have swayed him! Check out the photos from the night	<a href="<?echo $EXETEL_HOME_2006 ?>/07Jul/Engagement/Verandah.Bar/index.html" target="new">here</a> or click
