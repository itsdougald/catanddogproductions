		<h1>Beach Volleyball: Maroubra</h1>
		<p>
		Our six week beginners course has now come to an end. Playing at Maroubra beach, 10 minutes 
		south of Coogee, the Cat and I signed up for a six week course in Beach volleyball. 
		<a href="http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19894810-37639,00.html"  >Victor</a>,
		an ex-Australian beach Volleyball player himself, lead the <a href="http://www.beachvolleyball.com.au/">course</a> 
		with two fellow instructors	helping him out. Learning team positional moves, the piston stance and the many 
		ball manouvers such as the dig, set, camel toe (!), cobra, block and the all
		important spike, we're now masterfully skilled for competitions! The Cat has signed up for
	 	a combination of more lessons with games thrown in, just to keep her active before
	 	her all important football season kicks off early next year!
	 	</p>
	 	<p>
	 	Saturday 7th October @ 9am was our last lesson and Victor organised four teams of 4 or 5
	 	to battle it out in a mini tournament. With a fancy dress comp thrown in and most improved there
	 	were prizes to be had! My team were the "Horny Red Devils". Donned in red and wearing red
	 	devils horns but it was the Cats team who were smart.  They wore white t-shirts with "Love Victor"
	 	written on the front - good move and in fact won them the comp (surprise surprise)! With tight games played
	 	the Dogs team came through and won the mini tournament! There was no prize but I did manage to win a volleyball
	 	for coming up with a name for their weekly eNewsletter - "Dig Deep"!
