    <p>The 2nd Annual Octoberfest Cup was played out under blistery conditions at Wackerdon last night.</p>

	<p>Not even the gale force winds or the intermittent drizzle could dampen the enthusiasm of the 42 
	strong Wacker line up as they battled it our for the Wacker holy grail. After much initial confusion, 
	where the event instructions were finally translated into English, the starters gun went off and the 
	combatants were straight into the beer to see who could drink the most by half time. The winner was Cool 
	Hand Luke who's 12 bottles saw him falling over on the court and having several air swings as the rising 
	cursing crescendo from partner Short Black was heard by all over the top of the OmPaPah music.</p>
	<p>The glamorous buxom brigade cheered on from the sidelines as the Octoberfest tennis kept on getting 
	better and better as the beers in the fridge kept on getting less and less.<p>
	<p>A crisis point was reached at half time when 100 bottles had been drunk and only 12 remained, clever 
	Wackers jostled to secure them in strategic hiding places for post tournament consumption.</p>
	<p>The top seeds were bundled out in surprising fashion, Abs Of Steel and Master Blaster clashed with each 
	other as Abs was very upset by the Master's unwaxed thighs.</p>

	<p>"I cant believe the boof didn't shave down for the night, how am I supposed to play with those gorilla 
	legs staring at me all night?" complained Abs between rounds.</p>
	<p>Tinto and Man Mountain, our second seeds were unlucky on the night losing several matches by an odd sudden 
	deuce point. The quick fire format was not suited to some of our staying types.</p>
	<p>Second division favorites Brandy Alexander and Order In The Court fell to The Ombudsman and a sledging 
	Wine Barrel who once he got his nose in front employed underhand stalling tactics until Edwardo blew time.</p>
	<p>The all star Rabbitoh team of Garlo's Pies and Dr Death performed admirably on the night, not winning many 
	but displaying great potential that if they actual played tennis regulary could be naturals at the game.</p>
	<p>The only injury of the night occured when a sliding Stevie Wonder blew a knee en route to trying to pick 
	up a Frog Legs drop shot, hope it heals up soon Stevie.</p>
	<p>The 1st division final was won by The Assassin and our newby Haggis who proved he was top line Wacker 
	material by edging past Luke in the drinking stakes. Asa was disappointed to learn that the Audi at the 
	gates was not actually a prize for winning but had to settle for the token trophy instead.</p>
	<p>2nd division was taken out by The Ombudsman and super sub Caprioska who won a tight one against The 
	Roamer and Tee Vee who were desperate for a time extension as they felt they were getting on top towards the 
	end.</p>
	<p>When the food finally arrived at midnight the remaining Wackers feasted on German fare and raised their 
	glasses in honor of the great Uli Octoberfest, patron saint of the Wackers who was also fundamental in the 
	development of the Octoberfest Cup.</p>
	<p>After all 12 bottles of wine had been drunk a swaying Fox went on a brazen raid to siphon petrol from 
	cars in the street but was later found sleeping in the gutter with a strange smirk on his face.</p>
	<p>All in all a great time was had by all despite nearly staving to death, some Wackers nearly fainted and 
	others had to leave early to get some food on their way home before their stomachs began to consume themselves.</p>
	<p>Octoberfest Cup 2006 saw a record 112 bottles of beer, 12 bottles of wine, 100 German sausages, 3 kilos 
	of potato salad, 40 German pretzels, 5 loaves of bread, 1 litre of mustard and 12 BBq'd chickens consumed.</p>
	<p>Does anyone else have indigestion today?</p>
	<p>Lessons learnt for 2007?</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Get the draw done beforehand and print out the rules for everyone</li>
		<li>Serve the food earlier on the night</li>
		<li>Build a dome over Wackerdon to protect us from the elements</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Please feel free to post below and constructive suggestions, all welcome.</p>
	<p>Thank you to all for entering and participating in great spirit.</p>
	<p>Special thanks to The Octoberfest Cup Organisng Committe of Edwardo Roubles and The Ball Toss.</p>
	<p>A Big thanks as always to Short Black with the long schlong for cooking up a treat and a special 
	thanks to Edwardo Roubles for doing the draw.</p>
