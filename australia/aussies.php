	<h2>AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE Oi Oi Oi!!!</h2>
	<p>
	Since living in Aus (2005), we've worked through holiday visas, skilled visas, permanent residency and now finally we're 
	rinky dinky Aussies!!!
	</p>
	
	</p><strong>Email to the family:</strong> Hi faaaaamily!! Or should I say G'day!!!!??<br>

Well it's happened - V and I have now joined Sophia and Andre and become rinky dinky Aussies!<br>

The ceremony was on Thursday night at Randwick Town Hall. The night was a little long as there over 50 residents pledging their oath to Australia.....So before we were declared Aussies, we sang the Aussie anthem, pledge our loyalty to Australiia, collected our certificate from the Randwick Mayor....then were declared Aussies and sang the full Aussie anthem as an Aussie family - quite moving.<br>

I managed to capture the anthem singing once we were aussies - apologies for my voice!!!....but at the end of the ceremony we ate lamingtons, anzac biscuits and rice cakes made by the local girl guides of Randwick....plus given a plant to represent the land of Australia to take home (I managed to take 7 home 'cause we were the last out and the gardener encouraged me to take the lot!).<br>

Anyway it now means we can come and go out of Australia when want, which has taken 8 years to get to this...luxury(?)<br>

Head to this link: http://www.catanddogproductions.com/australia/aussies.php and Happy mothers day to Duck and Mother-in-law day to Barometer tomorrow!!<br>

Speak to you all soon.<br>

Lots of love,<br>
Dougeroo, Sheela V, Ranga and Dr.Dre. xxx
