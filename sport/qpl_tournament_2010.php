            <p>Hello Pork Jaffles (AKA: Porkettes)</p>

<p>Here is the first & last ever Sapanther wrap - it's actually really hard remembering all of the little events!! So here goes...
</p>
<p>Gala Day Date: Sunday 12th September.
</p>
<p>After a few of us had a dusty night Saturday (Happy Birthday Deans & Nic B) we all prepared to head down to David Phillips Oval for a glorious day of six-a-side football (12.5min halves).. of course Sam was late (maybe hungover and too tired to get out of bed lol) and was meant to pick Dougal up at 8:15am.. which turned into 8:50am.. on the way Chloe called to say Aly had also over-slept the mark (also too tired to get out of bed lol) and needed to be picked up.. so there was a quick detour to collect Aly, meanwhile Chloe made a bee-line to the registration desk to ensure we didn't get kicked out before we even started!
</p>
<p>We were a porkette short to start with (Jane was moving house until midday) but we were all finally at the field, boots on ready to roll by 9:15am: Caz, Chloe, Tahlia, Doorknob, Aly & Sam.. and Dougal running around hyperactive!
</p>
<p>First Match: 9:30am vs Waverly.
Match was off to a slow start, getting used to a 10m x 4m pitch (very skinny) was tough and there were a few stray 'rockets' kicked! Chloe was subject to the first injury of the day with a foot-crushing blow by one of the waverly chicks.. yet she soldiered on! A few long balls from Sam's goal kicks through to Tahls & Doonknob gave us a few chances but none quite close enough.. before we knew it Waverly were back on the attack and a cheeky corner and a tap from a player at the back post knocked it bang into the back of the net.. NNOO! 1nil. Never fear, Doorknob runs the next through ball down the line and smashes it as hard as humanly possible straight into the goal post giving the Waves keeper quite a fright, unfortunately hitting the post means a no goal! Unfortunately at the full time whistle, the score was still 1nil to Waverly.. damn them. PLUS Tahlia realises that she's done her knee - injury number two. ARRGGHH losing to Waverly again still burns just as badly!
End Result: Waverly - 1. QP - 0.
</p>
<p>Intermission: 2 hours.
Dougal decides we should all go and have a kick-around.. “where?” we all ask him - there are already 10 fields set up & main field being used, "Shooting practice.. at the Scoreboard" he remarks and piss-bolts over to the main score board.. this initiates the newest Porkette game.. shooting at the enormous scoreboard to try & knock as many numbers as possible off!! Good fun until we start hitting balls over the barbed wire fence!
</p>
<p>
Second Match: 12pm vs Glebe.
Jane arrived just in the nick of time - unfortunately with a sore back! Injury number 3! Alas we ran onto the field, rarring to go! Porkies owned the field! Quick passes, better control & lots of chatter meant that we were running rings around our friendly blue opponents! Jane was still getting used to the small field and in the process was slamming a few more of the famous long balls through the air and across 3 pitches haha!! Oh No, Sam has sprained her ankle (injury 4) but don’t despair Doorknob is catapulting down the wing.. weaving in.. out.. in.. out.. Doorknob SSCCCOOORRREEEESSSS!!!
End Result: QP - 1. Glebe – 0.
</p>
<p>
Intermission: 1.5 hours.
We head over to the shooting competition and enter Jane and Aly – shooting a soccer ball through hoops is quite a bit harder than it looks kids! Jane managed a whopping 5 points & Aly got 2 (each hoop had a different value).. then we all tuck into some bacon & egg rolls, sausage sandwiches & snow cones – nutritious energy food of course!
</p>
<p>
Third Match: 2:30pm vs Gladesville Ravens
This out of area team rolled up with their red & black striped jerseys looking angry & ready to take us on with everything they had. As we both ran onto the pitch and when the kick off whistle blew it was an even match until both teams settled in. Both teams have plenty of solid shots but none breaking through UNTIL goal from the Porkies! This caused a bit of unrest in the Ravens camp as both teams needed to pull off a win to make it to the semis! Porkies kept the passing going; up and down & inside & out, onto the wing only to slam yet another GOAL past their keeper! We’re excited. We’re Pumped. We’re Going To Come Out Trumps! Aly organises a perfectly placed throws in straight to Cazzie who looks at ease swating an amazing header into the top of the goal! Goals were flying left right & centre in this game much to the Ravens despair! This sees the Porkers through to the Semis..
Goal – Tahlia (super smooth and controlled knock right past the keeper).
Goal – Chloe (cracking left boot into the bottom left in true Chloe style)
Goal - Caz (super head into the top left off a throw in from Aly)
End Result: QP - 3. Ravens – 0.
</p>
<p>
Semi Final: 3pm vs Russell Lea
With a glint in our eyes the ladies in red quickly execute the “spirit fingers” routine and take the field for the semi final. With the wind having picked up the QP Ladies; Aly, Caz, Chloe, Doorknob, Jane, Tahlia & Sam; were in for a bit of a tough time. Russell Lea (RL) were fierce competition with a few pushy elbows and fast runs up the middle but that didn’t stop the Porkers!! Before you could say Pork Jaffle.. drum roll.. SCORE!!! A cracking goal by Tahlia was under our belts.
</p>
<p>
We hustled and muscled our way through the first half and finished up at half time up 1nil! A quick half-time break and an inspirational chat from Dougal saw us leap onto the field at full pace for the second half.. A few flicks from the RL ladies and they were running full pelt towards the Panther.. oh no, oh no, oh no.. and we were back even with the dark blue team after a fast paced goal by their striker! Heads Up Pork Chops we still had time yet! A few corners in a row for RL saw Jane have a few words with the RL striker which left a nasty taste in her mouth and a laugh on Jane’s!
Full time and we were 1-1.. so into golden goal time we go.. 3min each way and before we knew it full time again and we were looking at penalty shoot outs.. doh!
</p>
<p>
Penalty Shoot Outs: fark.
Sam wins the toss & elects to shoot second so she high tails it to the goal only to discover the kick is taken on the goal box line! This distance is about a metre and a half away from the goal line – you’re kidding right? No, so suck it up! Right, the first Russell Lea chick steps up, bang – Goal. Aly takes the first QP kick, bang – goal. RL2 organises herself, bang – goal. Chloe marches over to the goal, whistle blows,
RL keeper steps forward off the line, Chloe isn’t sure what to do, should she kick or not, she steps it forward & just misses. Don’t despair it’ll be a re-take – but no, the Ref says the keeper did nothing wrong & the result stands! What a joke! Don’t worry Chloe! RL3 step, kick, goal! Caz is QP3, bang - goal! RL4 steps up, the Panther has to change tack, the kick is taken too close to see what’s going on so she’ll have to pick a side to dive towards or jump forward or something!! RL4, step, bang – goal! Fark! Tahlia casually walks up, and knocks in the porkies third goal.. RL5, the last RL kicker, this is a must save goal to keep us in the game, whistle blows for the kick the RL chick draws back her leg to strike & Sapanther leaps/charges full pelt at her legs but misses (lol) and it’s another goal! Which means Sarah doesn’t get to take the final penalty shot.. Russell Lea 5 vs QP 4! Not to worry ladies – it was a valiant effort!
</p>
<p>
Summary: Porkies are awesome!
Beautiful day, nice & sunny.. plenty of snow cones.. gained some scoreboard numbers.. ate too many sausage sandwiches.. still hate waverly.. Lady V & Sofia as well as Charlotte, Mark and Bubba Tom came down to cheer us on.. Karla made some new friends playing the O35 QP team and setting up their goals.. We coined a new team name: Pork Jaffles (story to be told at another time).. got a little bit sunburnt.. and finally HAD FUN!!
</p>
<p>
Hope I didn't forget anything!

Thanks again for a great season Porkies, I’ll miss you all and am already sad I won’t be playing in 2011. I’ve booked my flights & I’m leaving Oz on 20th February 2011 so you have until then to get all of the Panther time you can handle J
