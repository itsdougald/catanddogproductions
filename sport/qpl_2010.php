            <h4><a name="match-14-10">Waverley Old Boys  3 (0) v (1) 2 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2010 Aug 8]</h4>
            Hiya Porkies,
            <p>
It is with great sadness and finality that I bring you.... the final Sunday Wrap for 2010....
</p>
<p>
Boo!
</p>
<p>
But let's get back to the start...
</p>
<p>
It was a chilly winter morning when the Porkies made their timely appearance at Moore Park. After a typically professional warmup, we had a bit of a kickabout to get us fired up. We were ready to face Waverley Old Boys, for the second time this season, and in a most important game.
</p>
<p>
The game started out very tense, with both sides holding their defensive lines high and most of the play being compressed into the centre of the pitch. The occasional through ball went over the defence, but neither side managed to convert these into a goal.
</p>
<p>
Waverley were a powerful side, with huge throw-ins and belting kicks that kept us on the back foot all the time, struggling to maintain possession.
</p>
<p>
The first turning-point of the game happened when the WOB keeper came out of her goal to pick up a ball that had been kicked a little too far by the Porkies. But alas, she was a bit too far out of her box and ended up picking up the ball outside the box. The referee ran over, brandishing a red card. She was sent off! WOB ran around to get another keeper to fill in, but the incident had rattled them enough that Tahlia managed to get past the keeper and calmly tapped the ball into the net. GOAL!
</p>
<p>This certainly brought our spirits up, and meant that we could focus our energies on getting another goal. But this was not to be, as the fierce Waverley side held onto the scoreline, even with only 10 players on the field, until the halftime whistle.
</p>
<p>
Even though the Porkies were 1-0 up at halftime, of course we did not become complacent. We came out in the second half just as fierce, making some great plays from the defence up through the middle, feeding balls to the strikers. But the Waverley defence were just too tight, and they denied our every chance. Not to mention a controversial episode in front of the goal where it seemed like a Waverley player scooped the ball out of the goal with her hand...
</p>
<p>About halfway through the second half and the scoreline was still 1-0, Waverley was gearing up for a corner. We tried to clear the ball out but it bounced at a funny angle off their player's head, tipping over Sammie and into the goal... 1-1.
</p>
<p>
The Porkies kept their heads up and battled on, trying to get some cheeky shots in, but nothing would get through. And then, another corner saw the ball get past our defence again and curl into the goal, making the scoreline 2-1.
</p>
<p>Again we tried not to let it get us down, and kept trying to make plays to get the ball into goal. But our every effort was denied. And the final nail in the coffin was a third goal to Waverley getting pasts us and hurtling into the goal... even a final goal from EK1, just before the final whistle, was not enough to see the Porkies win this match.
</p>
<p>
And so, with heads bowed, the Porkies said goodbye to another great season of football. Thanks ladies, it's been amazing training and playing with you. Here's to another brilliant season next year!
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to send through your Porky Points ASAP! Soon we'll be announcing the overall Player's Player for the season....
</p>
Cheers<br>

<h4><a name="match-14-10">Queens Park Lions 9 (5) v (0) 1 Queens Park Rangers</a> [ 2010 Jul 25]</h4>

Hi all,
<p>
Well today's match versus Queens Park Rangers started out a bit slow, with the warmup a bit unfocussed, some confusion around the match ball at the start of the game and a few nerves from the porkies. Dougal was tense on the sidelines as we struggled to gain dominance in the first half, lacking intensity and letting too many balls through.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, though, this lacklustre performance was only short-lived, as a long kick from Sam went over everybody's heads, was touched by Tahlia and soared into the goal. We were off! This first goal opened the floodgates for two quick follow-up goals from Emma, another from Tahlia and a final one from Emma. A harsh yellow card was awarded to Sam in the first half, for rolling the ball out to the corner with a bit too much force. She was not happy!
</p>
<p>
We finished the first half 5-0, although in the halftime talk Dougal quickly reset this to 0-0 as he reminded us to keep up the intensity for the second half.
</p>
<p>
We again struggled to do this, and the Rangers scored an early goal which put us on the back foot. However, we soon recovered and regained our game with a superb corner from Sarah converted into a goal with one touch from Tahlia.
</p>
<p>
This was closely followed by another goal from Tahlia, which slipped through the keeper's hands in slow motion to enter the goal. By this stage, we had it all over them again. Another sterling play saw the ball coming from Blonde Alex on the left, through to Tahlia and crossed across the face of the goal to Sarah, who tapped it into the net. Our ninth and final goal was scored by Sarah, who jumped over the keeper to run her ball into the goal.
</p>
<p>
The second half also saw a yellow card to Dani (I think for handling the ball in the box?), which also resulted in a penalty for the Rangers. In a repeat of one of our matches against them last year, their player took her time preparing to take the shot, rearranging her shin guards and pulling up her socks carefully. When she finally took the kick, Sam's stare must have psyched her out so much that she hit the ball too high, and it soared over the top of the crossbar.
</p>
<p>
But by that stage it didn't really matter, as the score was 9-1 to the Porkies. Rock on!
</p>
<p>
And don't forget to send through your player's player points ASAP!
</p>
Cheers<br>

<h4><a name="match-13-10">Queens Park Lions 2 (2) v (0) 1 Maroubra United</a> [ 2010 Jul 18]</h4>
Happy Monday Porkies near and far!!
<p>
Yesterday�s game at Queens Park pitch 26 was against the powerhouse Maroubra.  And it was EPIC!!!!
</p>
<p>
The lovely day began with Dougal�s two lovely ladies arriving at the park, much to the enjoyment of the team.  We gathered round to say hello to the vibrant Lady V and her 6 day old piglet, Sophia.  Tessa produced a darling red onesie with the letters �QPFC� on the front and �Guppy� with her mum�s number 3 on the back.  Dougal soon made us step away from his daughter for warm-up and our pre-game talk.  QPL have had a great run of games leading up to this match, but we were determined to stay focused and keep in mind that Maroubra is a wily bunch who take a metre if you give them an inch. 
</p>
<p>
The game began with skill and intensity from both sides, with Queen�s Park having a slight edge due to Maroubra�s 8-woman line up.  It wasn�t long at all before Sexy Bexy broke her curse by planting a low and composed ball from the top of the box into the lower corner of the net.  The Porkies squealed with delight!  We were winning to the infamous Maroubra! 
</p>
<p>
The game continued on fairly evenly but with Queens Park shutting down the oppositions attacks from the midfield and getting several decent shots on goal.  One of these feeds through the centre allowed Tahlia to run on and use her mad skills to fake out the last defenders.  Taking the ball to the right goal line and drawing the defenders and keeper out of the box, Tahlia placed the ball behind her with a heal pass to the eager Aly, who slammed the ball over the grasping hands of the goalie and into the upper 90 of Maroubra�s net.  Goal 2!  The ladies in red erupted in a cheer and trotted back to centre field to continue dominating!
</p>
<p>
To their credit, Maroubra did not let QPL�s run of goals affect their spirit.  The opposition continued to play hard and threaten QPL with some heart-stopping attacks.  This, paired with a--one might say--CONFUSED referee, kept the game exciting and the Porkies on our toes.  Much to our relief, Tahlia�s attacks soon paid off when she got control of the ball right in front of the goal and planted a brilliant shot on the ground to the far-post side net.  Maroubra�s keeper had no chance!
</p>
<p>
Queen�s Park seemed unbeatable, as our defensive line bunkered up to stop every attack Maroubra tried to filter through the middle.  Every time a Porky midfielder or defender was beaten, another stepped out from behind her to tackle the opposition.  Dougal�s latest coaching drills were showing some positive results!  However, Maroubra and the ref soon got us with some payback when one of the Maroubra sisters body tackled Deans at the top of the box, throwing her INTO THE AIR before she crashed into the ground.  No whistle was blown and a Maroubra forward shot the ball past our shocked defenders and our beloved Sapanther.  It was a frustrating blow, but so goes football!  We had to square our shoulders and keep playing our game.  Fortunately, the Porkies continued to play so well that no amount of debatable refereeing could skew the outcome of the game.  Chloe made sure Maroubra couldn�t claw their way back into the game when she controlled the ball in the midst of a scramble in Maroubra�s box, turned, and passed the ball straight past the goalie�s feet.  HUP Porkies HUP!
</p>
<p>
Thus, on Sunday, July 18th, the Porkies beat Maroubra 4-1, an ironic swap of points in comparison to our last match to the same team when we fell 1-4.  Word is, Maroubra has not been defeated in two seasons-- until now!
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for next match, when we meet up to play Waverly Old Boy�s, a match that is near guaranteed to be chock full of excitement!
</p>
Remember, email your porky points to Tessa!

<h4><a name="match-12-10">Queens Park Lions 10 (6) v (0) 0 UNSW</a> [ 2010 Jul 11]</h4>

Hello Porkies new and old! Welcome to the Sunday Wrap.
<p>
Hoping to capitalise on our stunning victory of last week, spirits were high before the beginning of the match against UNSW at David Phillips Sports Field. Having played on the same pitch last week, we were expecting to see the same hard-as-rock, encrusted dirt as last time. However, due to the rainfall during the week, said dirt had turned into a mushy pit of squelchy mud, which stank to high heaven.
</p>
<p>
Nothing the Porkies like better than to squish our trotters and roll around in the mud!
</p>
<p>
The match got off to a blazing start, with QP reprising their quality play of the previous game. Passes were accurate, space was made and defence held their line. It wasn't long before the first goal went sailing into the net... and then another one.... and then another one! We just seemed to keep making great plays from the back and converting them into cheeky shots over and around the keeper.
</p>
<p>
UNSW didn't know what had hit them as we danced around their players and scored zingers into the net. By the halftime whistle we were up 6 goals to zip - 3 of these were from EK1's lightning-fast boot, 2 from Blonde Alex's stunning crosses and one from Doorknob's Oranje laces. Superb!
</p>
<p>
The second half got off to a slower start, with the slippery mud proving challenging for this Porky to stay upright on her trotters! Sure enough, a few minutes in and we were all covered in the stuff - but delighting in it as the evidence of battle and solid challenges. And perhaps just of falling over.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it didn't take too long before Emma found the net again... and again, racking up 2 more goals towards her growing end-of-season tally. Doorknob managed to get in a few sneaky ones too, but mention must be made of Bex's record of assists as she was there for nearly every one!
</p>
<p>
By the end of the match, QP managed to keep a clean sheet and make it 10-0 - the third in a row of a many-to-zilch victory! Next week it's a face-off against Maroubra, and if we can bring our A-game they will have to put up a fight.
</p>
<p>
Have a great training session on Tuesday and I look forward to seeing you Friday night for Dougal's birthday shindig.
</p>
<p>
Oh and don't forget to send through your Player's Player points ASAP!

<h4><a name="match-11-10">Queens Park Lions 8 (5) v (0) 0 Glebe</a> [ 2010 Jul 4]</h4>

Happy USA Independence Day Porkies!  Today brought sunny skies, rainbows, and a kick-arse ninety minutes of soccer for the Queens Park Lions.  The team prepared with an updated and very structured warm-up to meet the Glebe Wanderers with our A-game, and welcomed a new addition to the team, Tahlia! 
<p>
The two teams met at centre-field to shake hand and get some last instructions from the referees, who were clad in pink shirts.   Today was Ladies Day on the pitch, and all referees worked for free to donate their pay to women�s cancer research.  What a day�good soccer and a good cause!
</p>
<p>
As the Porkies walked out onto the field, (and Sam ran from another field onto ours) our heads and hearts were in the game and the intensity at kick-off was unbelievable!  Communication was up, passing was on cue, work-rate was high, and shots were on target!  Our first goal of the match was the reward of Garg�s hard work and stellar cross over the keeper�s hands and to the back post.  All Aly had to do was �belly� it in (a signature American move) and GOOOAAALLLLLLL!
</p>
<p>
What followed can only be described as a sophisticated massacre.  EK2 placed some killer finesse shots into the corner of the net, and Chloe took advantage of her long shots to sail two into the upper net.  At half time the score stood at 5-0 to QP with a very ecstatic Dougal to keep us pumped for the next forty-five.  The Queens trotted back onto the field with the same amount of focus as the first time.
</p>
<p>
The second half was very similar to the first in matters of skill and intensity, with the exception of a very few sticky incidents when the ladies were caught not on their toes.  But thank goodness, the Sapanther hadn�t let her game idle and she cut down the attacks with some gorgeous saves, snatching the ball from above her head and sacrificing her body to slide in front of an attacker.   
</p>
<p>
Early into the second half however, Tahlia showed what a great asset she is to the team by placing the ball into the net as easy as pie!  Showing composure and superior ball skills, Tahlia snatched two goals for the Porkies, widening the lead to 7- zilch!  Soon after, we won a PK in the box and Aly buried the ball in the net to bring the final score to 8-0.  Our well-respected but thoroughly defeated opponents congratulated the Porkies after the final whistle blew, and Queens Park sang their victory song with glee! 
</p>
 
Congratulations to Dougal and the Queens Park Lions. Enjoy the rest of your weekend and remember, as Miley Cyrus says, �It�s a party in the USA!� so enjoy a pint and toast to the much improved Porkies!!

<h4><a name="match-10-10">Queens Park Lions 8 (2) v (0) 0 Pagewood B</a> [ 2010 Jun 27]</h4>

Hey all,
<p>
Welcome to the Porkies Match Wrap for the 27th of June!
</p>
<p>
We all started out shivering on the sidelines at Queens Park, the sun falling behind clouds making the day a bit chilly. Eager to warm up, Dougal led us in a more structured warm-up than usual. Looking over at the opposition, we realised that they only had 8 players!
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, the first half left much to be desired. Unfortunately, QP started out sluggish, lacking energy and enthusiasm and just trying to score long-range goals. These were easily blocked by their defence, as they had about 6 players along the back line! On the few occasions we managed to break through, our shots were just not on target, either sailing high or wide of the goal.
<p>
This was very frustrating, as the subs tried to pump up the energy to no avail. At long last, Sarah Doorknob managed to get one into the net. Relief wash over us. Goal!
</p>
<p>
This was followed up not long after with Gargs finally converting one of her many chances into another goal.
</p>
<p>
After the whistle blew for halftime, Dougal was not happy! He took us for a run over the other side of Queens Park to give us a talking-to. We were urged to lift the energy, the pace and make solid plays down the wings rather than through the middle.
</p>
<p>
The team talk paid off, as we started the second half with much more enthusiasm. Playing with a new configuration with three at the back, we were all poised to be the attacking side and create a significant goal difference.
</p>
<p>
Even though Pagewood had gained another player during the break, we played some great football and managed to put away not one, not two, not even three, but SIX goals in the second half!! The scorers were: Sarah with another one, Emma with THREE, Deans and Blonde Alex to round out the rest.
</p>
<p>
So finally, inevitably, we had reduced the Pagewood defence to a yellow-card drawing rubble, as we skilfully danced around them and took our time in front of the net. Yay for Porkies!!
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to send through your match points for each game.
</p>
<p>
At Vicky's baby shower, Dani gave her an awesome Flying Porky toy for the baby, so it's her who wraps up this wrap!:

<h4><a name="match-09-10">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (1) 2 Dunbar Rovers</a> [ 2010 Jun 26]</h4>
Today's match was a tough one against Dunbar at Queen's Park.  The team trickled in and began our warm-up led by Nic and Nicola, as Dougal was away at a coaching session.  Our stand-in coach was Nicola's loverly husband Mark. Thanks Mark!
As soon as the first ball was played it was obvious Queen's Park was a step slower than our usual play.  Our normal communication and polish just wasn't there, and Dunbar took advantage of our flat play by continually feeding flighted balls through our trusty back line, and giving Sam a good work-out.  Midway into the first half Dunbar popped one into our net off of a flighted cross from the goal line.  Queens Park continued to play hard but just could not put together an attack to return Dunbar's goal.  After a tough first half the team sat down to hear some words of inspiration from today's coach Mark.  Thus, with out heads up we jogged back onto the field with determination.
The second half showed a marked improvement in our communication and passing.  Chloe and Aly in the centre started winning balls to distribute and our forwards and wings put together several fabulous attacks that began to unsettle our opponent.  Alex G, Nicola, and Sarah "Doorknob" all had beautiful shots and crosses, and each attack lifted QPL's spirits as we relinquished our usual intensity.  
However, Dunbar continued to rocket flighted balls at our defense, and though Danni, Fiona, Caz, Nic, and Deans fought tooth and nail, a tiny error and a little bad luck saw a breakaway for a Dunbar forward, who slammed a very well-aimed shot into our near-post net.  Though Queen's Park finally got our mojo back throughout the tough game, we unfortunately left the field with a 2-0 loss to Dunbar.  
As we warmed-down Nic and Nicola offered some words of wisdom and support, and we began to think positive for out future games.  Tomorrow we play at Queens Park again, and we will definitely be bring Pagewood B DOWN.  One thing is for sure, the team is back and ready to bring on some annihilation!
<p>
Please remember to send your Porky Points to Tessa!  See you all tomorrow at 12 for warm-up!
 </p>

<h4><a name="match-08-10">Queens Park Lions 3 (1) v (1) 1 UNSW</a> [ 2010 Jun 14]</h4>
Evening Porkies!
<p>
Aly sent through the wrap for Sunday's match, so here is the wrap for the second half of our "personal world cup."
</p>
<p>
We rocked up to Heffron 55, anticipating a match against a team we hadn't played before - UNSW. We felt a bit sore from yesterday, a little tired from being up watching the Socceroos awful defeat, but ready and rearing to go. They looked young, they looked short, and they looked like they were ready for a match! 
</p>
<p>
We kicked off, and it was clear from the start that while they were speedy, we were the more experienced side and we were able to hold possession for longer. A couple of dodgy hand balls and a dodgy ref later, they got close to the goal and slammed one into Sam. Unfortunately, though she just got a hand to it, it got the better of her and rolled into the goal.
</p>
<p>
Never to be defeated, us Porkies kept our heads held up high, made some great plays and continued to dominate. Our efforts finally paid off when Sarah beat the keeper and hit an equaliser into the back of the net.
</p>
<p>
We trotted off at half time happy to be back on level footing, but fully realising the work that still had to be done to win this game in the second half.
</p>
<p>
The second half proved to be even more challenging than the first, as we started to get tired and lose form. This meant the game became rather scrappy as both sides fought for possession and we were all playing the ball into the air.
</p>
<p>
Eventually though, we managed to get it under control again and our fearless Dutchwoman Sarah worked some magic again in front of the goal, slamming another shot at the keeper, which she fumbled and let in. 2-1 to the Porkies!
</p>
<p>
Although we were all elated to be ahead, there were more than a few dramatic moments near our goal as they almost got shots in. Until Jane got her foot to the ball for one of her signature arching crosses, which sailed into the box... and then kept going into the goal!! We must continue this trend of scoring from the defensive line, ladies...
</p>
<p>
So the final score was 3-1, QP again victorious for our World Cup Weekend!
</p>
<p>
Injured Chloe was watching from the sideline for most of the match, but left before we could announce that she won the Porky for our last game!! Chloe - Fiona has the trophy for you...
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to send through your points for each of the weekend's matches individually. See everyone next weekend!

<h4><a name="match-07-10">Queens Park Lions 1 (0) v (0) 0 Pagewood</a> [ 2010 Jun 13]</h4>
This weekend was the Porkies� personal world cup, with two games over the long weekend.  Game one was at Queens Park, where we met Pagewood for combat, airing our white uniforms for the first time this season.  Having been through a lull, with multiple games cancelled to rain, the Queens warmed up for the game licking their chops in anticipation.
<p>
At the start of the first half it was quite obvious that Pagewood was no match for the mad skills of the Porkies�however, the latter was not stepping to the ball or showing the intensity of which QP is capable.  Thus, Pagewood kept winning the 50/50 balls and play lingered too close to the Porkies� goal for Sapantha�s comfort. 
</p>
<p>
In the last 45 Queens Park came back with a BANG.  With some great combinations in the back and mid field and plenty of crosses in front of the goal-- expertly sent by both Alex�s-- a goal for the Porkies seemed imminent.  But we kept missing the frame!!  With a couple of scary exceptions, one in particular that involved a Pagewood forward missing our open goal at 4 yards out, QP kept the ball in possession on the opposition�s side.  Queen�s Park surrounded Pagewood�s box for a majority of the last half, and the amount of unmet attacks and shots was re. dic. u. lous. 
</p>
<p>
But finally, like a ray of light in a dark tunnel, like the Golden Ticket to our Chocolate Factory, validation of the Porkies� hard work came in the form of Nicola.  Playing in defense, she took the ball on a cheeky run and sent the ball flying, flying, flying into Pagewoods back net.  GOOOOAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL.  Nicola �airplane arms� Hopkins joined her teammates in a cheer of victory, the clock counted down to zero, and the ref blew the final whistle.
</p>
<p>
After, the victorious Queens Park took a few team photos and went home to prepare for today�s showdown at Heffron. 
</p>
Cheerios!<br>

<h4><a name="match-06-10">Glebe 0 (0) v (0) 2 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2010 May 16]</h4>

To the ladies and Dougal of Queens Park:
<p>
Today was a Most Glorious Success for the ladies in red!  The team assembled at Moore Park today at 12:15 to warm up for a 1 pm KO against Glebe, and experienced some slightly bizarre weather at the start, when a dark cloud parked on top of the field and squelched out some rain in the midst of a sunny and blue sky.  As the starters took their places on the pitch the weather cleared and the game began!
</p>
<p>
To be honest, the play lacked a bit of intensity on both sides in the first few minutes and the Queens of the Pork struggled to get control of an ever-bouncing ball.  We experienced an especially painful loss when three HULKING Glebes took Emma out of the game in the first ten minutes.  But then, like a raging volcano, the pressure built and built, and EXPLODED into a game rich with desire, aggression, and bee-a-u-tiful ball work.  In the back, Jane, Fiona, Deans, Nic, Tess, and Dani held their line tight and high.  The opposition had some nasty forwards putting pressure on our dear back line--but they worked hard and smart to cut out any opportunities, and SaPantha served a big 'Hell No' to any attempts on our goal, saving our asses in some pretty hairy moments (tee hee gross pun).  In the mid Gargs, Bex, Back Aly, Chloe, and BAMF kept the attack going, transitioning from defense to offense like champs.  The middies showed some grit, fighting one-on-one to win some tough 50-50 balls.  And in the front, Sarah, Hoppy, Carla, and Bex were a real presence against the defenders to find each other and capitalize on every scoring opportunity!
</p>
<p>
The battle raged on for the better part of the game, with QPFC having the slightest edge.  Both teams had a few near-goals that were kept out by some fabulous (and scarily angry) goal-tending.  Just when it seemed that time was running out The Amazing Chloe put a free kick in Glebe's upper net, easy peasy as pumpkin pie!  We celebrated and reminded each other to stay in the game and keep up the defense.  Well, we did keep up the defense as well as the offense.  Again, The Amazing Chloe shot a ball through the melee and into the side of the net.  GOOOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLL.
</p>
<p>
And that was that!  A few minutes later the fat lady sang (or the tiny and uncertain ref blew his whistle) and we shook Glebe's hands and thanked them for a fantastic game.  Then, in true Porkies fashion, we entered Dougals 'Circle of Love' and sang the Mighty Might Queens Park victory song!!
</p>
<p>
Well done to everyone today and thanks to our loyal fans--  QPFC is becoming a closer, stronger, and smarter team every week and I can't wait to fight for our Most Glorious Success next week!
</p>
<p>
REMEMBER everyone send your porky points to the Tessa!
</p>
With Porky Love,<br>

<h4><a name="match-05-10">Queens Park Lions 1 (0) v (4) 4 Dunbar Rovers</a> [ 2010 May 9]</h4>
Hiya Porkies,
<p>
Today was another warm one as we kitted up and prepared to face our old rivals, Maroubra, at Heffron 55. Dougal was easy on us during the warmup, not making us run around too much in the heat. Much appreciated!
</p>
<p>
After a good ol' team huddle, in which we decided to start strong, and keep playing our own game, we trotted out onto the pitch. Ready to play our own game, no matter what. Our fiery spirits lasted a good 15 minutes or so, and we dominated in the first moments of the game, taking Maroubra by surprise as we held our own and created some chances.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, though, our streak was short-lived, as we conceded a goal to a signature 1-2 play by the sisters up front. Not to be defeated, we put our heads up and battled hard, but our efforts did not pay off as we conceded another goal shortly after.
</p>
<p>
This double-whammy shook the Porkettes for the next 15 minutes or so, as Maroubra tried everything they could to ride their goal-scoring surge forward. We struggled to hold them back, which ended in them scoring another 2 goals in quick succession.
</p>
<p>
As much as we tried to keep our heads up, going down 4 goals in such a short amount of time is enough to rock anyone's confidence, and it took us awhile to get ourselves back on top again. Slowly but surely, we clawed back control of the game. Sam made a few magnificent saves and we created some chances down the wing.
</p>
<p>
But still, as the half-time whistle blew the score remained at 4-0.
</p>
<p>
After a characteristically upbeat team talk at half-time, we ran back out on the pitch renewed, full of energy and determination to turn this half around.
<p>
And we did a damn fine job. Maroubra's defence started to crumble as we made some solid plays and built up attack. They were often getting caught offside by our strong back line, thanks to the linesmen! We switched up the play and kept them guessing. This half certainly was a turnaround from the first!
</p>
<p>
A few choice moments: Karla's mid-air karate kick tapped the ball, Matrix-style, towards the net. But alas, their keeper was a little too quick and grabbed hold of it before it could score. Also, one of Sapather's runs out to the wing meant that Deans, covering the goal, was forced to make a sensational save with her head. Well done ladies!
</p>
<p>
The best moment, though was when Blonde Alex saw her chance and fired a cross over from the left wing, which was tipped slightly up by the keeper's fingers, only to land in the net behind her. SCOOOOOOOORE!!
</p>
<p>
So the game ended 4-1, with the Porkies winning the second half and showing that not even Maroubra can keep us down.
</p>
<p>
Don't forget to send through your points for the match - 3 to the top performer, then 2 and 1 to another 2 significant contributors.
</p>
See you for training on Tuesday!<br>

Cheers<br>

<h4><a name="match-04-10">Dunbar Rovers 1 (0) v (0) 0 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2010 May 2]</h4>

Hello Everybody!
<p>
Today was a cooker as the team assembled at the Reg Bartley Oval at Rushcutter's Bay.  We had a few lovely ladies out of commission for today's match but thankfully Dom from the over 35s very graciously stepped in to play goal with the porkies, and Nic and Emma arrived to cheer us on!
Dougal knew Dunbar would be a tough adversary but as always kept things positive and focused on our game.  We got warm and got pumped up to play next to a flat pitch and the sparkling water-- what a great day and setting to play soccer!
</p>
<p>
Kick off at 1 pm saw the game slam into action with Dunbar fast on the ball and QP up on our toes and quick to defense.  True to their records, Dunbar was a good team- possessing some quick attackers, a strong and skilled centre, and a shrewd back line.  But us Porkies held our own!  The intensity was incredible and we put Dunbar under high pressure.  The back line made Dunbar's attackers virtually obsolete in the first 45 and Queens Park had several attacks down the line.  The game was fairly even, transitioning to both sides of the pitch with well deserved attacks from each team.  Queen's Park had the majority of the first half's attacks but unfortunately they only developed into a fair  few corner kicks and several shots on goal.
</p>
<p>
As second half rolled around it was obvious that the heat was starting to affect both teams, but Dunbar came back onto the field with a bit more of an edge than the lovely Porkettes.  Within the first ten minutes Dunbar slipped one in the corner of our net with a well aimed shot from the top of the box.  Never to be put down, Queen's Park battled for the rest of the game and held off every other attack, with some seriously badass saves from Dom in goal.  FOr the majority of the last 45 Dunbar sent ball after ball after ball over our defense, resulting in a series of foot races for Fiona, Caz, Tessa, Danni, and Jane.  Hurray for them all because every single time they shut Dunbar DOWN.  The Porkettes' attack desperately tried to return the favor of a goal but Dunbar's defense parried every attack with success.  In the end the score stood at 0-1 to Dunbar, and Queen's Park left Rushcutter's Bay without the sweet taste of success.  
</p>
<p>
But of course, the Porkies always think positive and focus on our own play-- and the truth is, we had a smashing game.  Every single person went above and beyond on the pitch and improved their personal game in some way.  THere is no question that we are getting stronger and are a force to be reckoned with.  Three cheers for Queens Park!!!
</p>
<p>
Hope to see everyone at training on Tuesday and REMEMBER to send your game points to Tessa!

Cheers,<br>

<h4><a name="match-03-10">Queens Park Lions 3 (2) v (1) 1 Queens Park Rangers</a> [ 2010 Apr 25]</h4>
<p>
Hi there Porkettes!
 </p>
<p>
Well it was a nice cool day to play football yesterday, as we fronted up at (an undressed) Heffron 55 for the match. This was set to be a bit of a grudge match, as we played against the other Queen Park team, the Rangers.
 <p>
But it was clear from the kickoff that we, the Lions, were going to dominate this game. We had the wind with us and the sun against us, but we managed to keep it in their half for the majority of the first half of the match. The only times they would get away was when one of their fast forwards had a break. Unfortunately, one of these breaks resulted in the first goal of the match against us. As usual, though, this early goal only served to make the Porkies more fired up to equalise.
 </p>
<p>
And equalise we did, with Sarah (playing up front!) knocking one into the goal between the keeper's legs! Yay!
 </p>
<p>
As the half went on, we continued to dominate and have many other chances on goal. Unfortunately many of these went straight for their keeper, so it took a stunning ball from Bex out to Blonde Alex on the right wing, who speedily ran the ball up the flank, cut inside and around the keeper and slammed it home. 2-1 to the Porkies at half time!!
 </p>
<p>
The second half begun, and though we now had the wind against us we continued our domination, connecting passes to each other and building some strong plays. Sam did have to pull some great saves, but we kept a clean sheet as the opposition started to look tired.
 </p>
<p>
Then, after quite a few chances, Sarah managed to get another one by the keeper, solidifying our victory. And the final score was 3-1 - Porkies victorious!!
 </p>
<p>
Hope you all had a great time at the pub afterwards and a deserving celebration.
 </p>
<p>
Don't forget to send me your porky points ASAP!
 </p>
<p>
See you Tuesday.

<h4><a name="match-02-10">Waverley Old Boys 2 (2) v (0) 0 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2010 Apr 18]</h4>
It was a warm afternoon as the Porkies went through their pre-game warm ups yesterday at Moore Park. Looked upon by their die hard fans (Danni's mum) the ladies got warm and stretched for the game as their Coach got them prepared to play with some pre-game words. Dougal remarked that the team seemed a bit flat and the wise coach's words turned out to be true on the pitch. Soon after kick-off WOB managed to pop one in the net with a sneaky pass to the corner of the frame. Waverley Old Boys continued to beat Queens Park to the ball by a few seconds every time with a combination of long balls, strength, and tenacity. With Queens Park lacking some intensity and organization amongst each other another early goal for the opposition soon followed.
<p> 
The mighty mighty Queen's Park then slammed into action, and the stoic defensive line kept the ball at the offensive side of the field for the better part of the first half. The attack continued to make shots on goal but unfortunately just couldn't get the ball inside the frame. Despite holding Waverley Old Boys to a series of goal kicks, the score remained 0-2 when the half-time whistle blew.
 </p>
<p>
The Porkies showed no signs of defeat at half-time, kept things positive, and endeavored to learn from their mistakes. The second half showed an impenetrable defense, an organised and mobile midfield, and a deadly attack. The well-oiled machine moved the ball up the pitch toward WOB's net over and over but was foiled by the opposition's off-sides traps, a lack of referee linesman, and an aggressive defense.  
With some stellar saves in goal by Sam, strong serves up from the defensive line, and some cutthroat defense by Caz (such as accidentally kicking someone in the face), QP held off all of WOB's attacks, eliminating any chance to increase the other team's lead.  Alex sent some cracker corner kicks across WOB's box but the Porkies struggled to capitalize.  Chloe and Bex had very near-goal runs that ended in some questionable scuffles in the box and unfortunately the ball in the keeper's hands.  
 </p>
<p>
In the end, the Porkies congratulated Waverley Old Boys on their 2-0 victory and they jogged off the field.  Though the end score was a disappointment, Queens Park steadily improved throughout the game and certainly gave the opposition a run for their money.  The ladies warmed down and showed off their battle scars (Bex has a blue and green cankle- hope its doing better!) and there was no evidence of dejection of defeat, and instead determination to meet Waverley Old Boys on the soccer field again.  
 </p>
<p>
As the Porkies rambled off the feild and into the sunset- some to the pub, and others to dogsit a crotchety but cute puppy named Oscar- the same thing was on everyone's mind: Waverley Old Boys better be ready for the next time we meet on the pitch!
 </p>
<p>
REMEMBER to send your game points to Tessa everyone!  3 pts to your first choice and 2pts/1pts to the runners up, respectively!
 </p>
Cheers,<br>

<h4><a name="match-01-10">Queens Park Lions 4 (3) v (0) 0 Pagewood</a> [ 2009 Apr 11]</h4>

  Hello all!
<p>
 
Welcome to the inaugural Porkies Sunday Match Wrap for 2010!
 </p>
<p>
The day was a hot one, with the sun bearing down on us as we warmed up at a newly turfed Queen's Park. We were eager to play though, especially after a Dougal Drone, and ready to face off against our old nemeses, Pagewood. But when we lined up against them in the centre of the field, we realised that it was not the usual Pagewood team we had been talking about - in fact it was last year's division 3 team who had come up to 1st division.
 </p>
<p>
The new turf claimed its first victim in only the first few minutes, as Emma rolled her ankle and was cast off to the sidelines for the remainder of the match. Boo! Not to worry though, we picked ourselves up and went on to play some great football.
 </p>
<p>
For the first while, it seemed a fair fight, with Pagewood giving just as good as they were getting from us. But eventually we wore down their reserves of energy and our first goal scored went to Alex (Hackett - Alex G's new name is "Gargs"!!!). No long after, successive goals were scored by Chloe and Alex again to make these pooped Porkies 3-nil up at half time. The heat was really starting to get to us, but we rehydrated and kept our heads up for the second half.
 </p>
<p>
Pagewood were really showing signs of weariness in the second half, and for the most part we kept the ball in their half. We had many chances on goal, clearly dominating, though only one of these made it through to goal - an awesome strike by Bex.
 </p>
<p>
So we finished up the match 4-0 to Queen's Park - yay! An outstanding result for the first game together as a half-new team!
 </p>
<p>
Every week, we award a Porky trophy for the player of the match from the previous week's game, and two runners-up. Please send me your points for this every week. Award 3 points, 2 points and 1 point to the three players you see fit. Please get these to me ASAP so I can tally them up and we can present the Porky at the next match.
 </p>
<p>
By the way, we are calling for expressions of interest for other wrappers - if you're interested in doing the match wrap, maybe every second week or so, please let me know!
 </p>

Cheers<br>
Tess<br><br>
 
P.S: Ems, hope your ankle is feeling better!
