	 <p><strong>End of Season Summary Report, written by Coach Dougal [18th Dec]</strong></p>
        <p>Boy our team has gone from strength to strength. The loyalty, the passion and enthusiasm is just outstanding. As I said in my thank you speech
	 after our grand final defeat, at Coopers in Newtown, what counts is the burning desire of the players to play and as a team and this was the case! 
        </p>
	<p>
	With a smaller squad of 16, to accommodate the headaches from too bigger squad in 2008, brought in 7 new playes (Alana, Caz, Charlotte, Emma, Ky and Nina) 
	to replace the 9 we lost (Annette, Chrissy, Emma Cassim, Holly, Kelly, Liz, Marga and our very own captain Sandra (temporarily)).
	</p>
	<p> Going up a division, division 2 to be precise, essentially a new team and judging by my first year of coaching in div 2 back in 2007, really didn't know what
	lay in store for the season ahead (honestly!). Pre-season started off well; once the trials were over and allocated players to our three QP teams and an EGM
	held with some of our very own QP players to discuss our squad, held a BBQ after our first training session at QP. It went down a treat. We all got to know
	each other with a round of introductions, firstly with me enlightening the new players of what they'd signed into - the Queen's Porkers, crikey!
	</p>
	<p>Our season started how I felt should have ended - with an emphatic and comfortbale win. With a new kit, new warm up and a new fresh attitude
	we faced Dunbar Rovers, who'd previously beaten us 6-1 and 7-0 in 200	and broke one of ours players ribs. As you can imagine we had a point to prove. 
	We made them look very average. 2 quick goals, with the first coming from our new talented striker Nina, we looked and played so professionally. It was a pleasure to watch. 
	The pre-season training paid off and felt the positions were spot on. With a 4 nil win, we topped the league and the Porkies were squeeling all the 
	way to our new pub sponsors Paddington Arms. Unfortunately on the downside we had lost three players, one for good (Janelle Black), Nina (for 75% of the season) and 
	Ky (on and off for 50% of the season) - it was a severe blow and changed the dimension of our team, heavily.
	</p>
	<p>
	Losing the following two matches to Maroubra and Waverley (a narrow 1 nil defeat), the Porkies were a little disappointed but still confident. With an injury 
	list now soaring and Nic missing training and matches through work, had to act fast with Nicola (our new captain!) to recruit a suitable player. We found Juls. 
	Coming down to training on short notice for a trial and impressing, we signed her up. We had a crucial 1-0 win again Loko, who came up with us a division, was good to know
	we had Juls bolstering our squad for a local derby against QPR! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Boy it felt great to face QPR again - hasten to add they were league and grand final winners of division in 2008. We had a point to prove and boy did we prove it! Our song was 
	was sung at the top of our voices after an extraordinary match. Hissy fits, penalties and some cracking goals, had a great day at the office. This game really brought our team together, 
	especially after seeing QPR players acting so immaturely and unsportingly to us and each other! It was a proud day to be a QPL coach, it really was. Hitting the Paddington Arms afterwards
	, a few of the QPR players sat with us - stating their admiration for a football and our team spirit. It doesn't get better than that, I tell ya.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next up for was Glebe. Arch rivals indeed. Fortunately, the skanky number 10, Amanda had left, but they still had their annoying supporter on the sidelines, provoking 
	and taunting our players. Tw&t!!!!!! So to our team players who joined in 2008, this game was really our rival match. Traditionally they went in front, but the grain
	of play was well matched, it really was....but here's where Emma Kirkaldy really showed her quality and fitness. Previously running a half marathon in the morning, was subbed on
	immediately and single handedly too the ball from inside Glebe's half, took it to inside their box and rifalled in a shot (cross?) into the far post. 1-1 and we knew were going
 	to win. Scoring two more had a comfortbale lead of 2 until the dying mintutes. A sloppy goal went in but we'd won. So round 1 completed we were sitting third.
	Four wins and two losses. Not a bad start for a new team and a new tougher division, but more importantly a happy, buzzing team with a few socials lined up already!
     </p>
	<p>
	We continued the second half season solidly. Facing Dunbar Rovers, weren't sure if our first game against them was too good to be true. It wasn't. With Juls making a difference too, we
	went raced 3 nil ahead by half time, eventually finishing a very happy 4-1. we were looking like a top division 2 team. If we had our full squad injury free the rest of the 
	season would have been straight forward, but hey, straight forward is just not cricket! Maroubra ripped the heart and soul out of our team, totally. 
	With players joining in 2008, never experienced a Porky whipping. The scoreline did not justify our efforts. ALmost equalising and causing problems for Maroubra,
	we showed weeknesses and they knew them - on the counter attack, ripped down the wings quickly and split our defense in half. It didn't help with two off-side golas but 
	that's making excuses. We lost. Badly. So with the trotters blunted and questions being asked by everyone, training deemed important but more importantly whispers
	of doubt had to be eradicated.
	</p>
	<p>
	Facing Pagewood, we certainly had our worst defeat in the history of the Porkies. With a pre-match insult from "Couch", certainly helped our form; perhaps not the soul,
	but we finished none of our attacks early on to take control. Pageweood held tight, Vicky was pushed over and called a Pansy(!!) and there scoring account opened.
	We were missing our all important Sapanther, so our injured fill in, Nina, now newly named, "The Kitten" took the keepers helm. A cheap goal from a free-kick cost us. With 2-1 down at 
	half time we still looked to get something from the game. Things got messy on the field, tempers were frayed. Kitten was desparate to help and injured Sapanther helped. 
	Sapanther coming on, Kitten went up front and hit the post within seconds. This was her only real chance, but Pagewood scored the third and final goal and numbed
	us all. The 15 year old ref finalised the game, blew the whistle and our heads went down. Sitting on the floor, we were all so shell shocked. Our season, looking to be short,
	could be coming to a bitter, flat end.....or was it?....</p>
	<p>
	With Juls now missing for two games, our new fill in, it was getting frustrating. Plus with more injuries and absent faces, we really had to count on the core. Sitting mid table now,
      were facing second placed Waverley Old Boys. We needed something from this game. At least a point else, a top four spot would have been very, very difficult. Adding a fun kick-ups to our warm-up
 	to take the tough task ahead of our minds, worked well. Although WOB took an early goal, we played some simple, yet effective football. With V and Deans in the middle, won everything on the 
	ground and the air. EK1 dropped a little deeper giving the Porkies a 4-4-1-1 look. Sapanther taped up her bad ankle too. Although making a bad mistake, as always made some
	crucial saves. Drawing 2-2 we were elated with the result. We knew with our injured players back and EK2/nina back from hols we could beat them if we played them in a play-off! 
	</p>
	<p>
	The social's cames thick a fast from here. With nina organising two Twisted DJ nights, upstairs at the infamous Flinders bar. Fantastic. The team really gelled and everyone
	felt we could finish the season on a high! With four matches to play we were ready for battle. Taking on QPR and defeating them weas sweet success. Climbing up the table
   	also defeated Glebe the week after. All of a sudden the hedonistci days with The Porkies were back and feeling invincible; seriously!!! With two matches left, were unsure whether
	we were playing a third round of matches. With a rained off game played against Pagewood had a chance to put our nightmare match on Jun 7th to bed. We did. We ripped apart
	with power, skill and unity! So stick your South American flag up your beeeeeep Pagewood!! Alana's new found position, central midfield had scored two golas from the three games 
	and we faced Loko the next day. Loko were propping up the table, so had nothing to lose. Making life difficult for us, it was 1-1 at half time. With a positive blast to the team
	got the Porky psyche up and flowing. We looked like a different team again. We looked like division 2 champions. It was a great half to watch and so happy to finish third in the league,
	which we feel, if we had another round of league games would finish second, above WOB and perhaps with the origianl fit squad of the start of the season, perhaps first...but injuries are part 
	of the season's journey.
</p>
	<p>
	So with a big customery night at the Lowenbrau for "Couches" Birthday, we'd recently learnt that ESFA had dealt us a card we certainly didn't expect. Not knowing, at all, whether
	we were going straight into play-offs, were told that ALL points were to be cleared and splitting the division in half to play a round-robin with the top two teams going into a play-off.
	Apparently this was unaminously voted for at an EGM. Glebe, who finished fifth in the league made the deciding vote and pushed for the round robin approach.
	Interesting. At first annoyed, but after some thought, looking at our "new" league, had Pagewood (yuck), Glebe and WOB, so if we were to beat all three, would feel like we'd finished second in the league.
	Just going back to the night out, there were usual QP antics. Dance offs, bear hugging, picking up, dry humping, lots of laughter and plenty of sweat!
	</p>
	<p>
	...and that we did! Was fairly straight forward with Pagewood, Glebe were a little tougher, but beating Waverley Old Boys 1 - 0 was just fantastic! They are a tough side to beat, so with a loss, draw and a 
	win makes it even, but you're only as good as your last! Finishing top of our mini-league, were facing Dunbar in the semi-finals, knockout competition.

        <h2>Match Reports 2009</h2>
<h4><a name="match-20-09">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (1) 1 Maroubra United</a> [ 2009 Aug 23]</h4>
Dearest Porkettes,
<p>
It is with a mixture of sadness and joy (that I don't have to do these anymore) that I bring you the final Sunday Wrap for 2009. Now wipe those tears away....
</p>
<p>
Yesterday was, of course, the grand final. We were playing Maroubra, a team who dominated the league and beat us 4-0, 6-1 & 5-1 this season. However, we were determined to get out there and give it everything to win.
</p>
<p>
Turning up at the pitch, we discovered a changeroom for the team. Very fancy! Dougal laid out the tactics and we got pumped up by listening to Pink! on repeat. The match before ours went into extra time and penalties, so our start was a little delayed. Nevertheless, we stayed energised in the heat of the day, ready to get out and take on the 'Bra Girls!
</p>
<p>
We trotted over to our dugout, complete with team balloons, ready to begin. The first half was tough, as we realised just how hard playing in this heat and against these fit players was going to be. Unfortunately, we conceded an early goal which meant we had to dig in even further to get it back. We had quite a few chances, but none managed to make it into the net, as their defence kept getting to the ball. After a little while, Maroubra scored a second goal, which pinged the post and then went into the goal.
</p>
<p>
We were two down, but this just made us more hungry. We matched Maroubra step for step and played one of our best games all year. We showed our tenacity for the game as we powered on and didn't let Maroubra dominate us. But still, the damn ball just wouldn't go into the goal! The half ended at 2-0.
</p>
<p>
The second half began, and we knew the work we had to do to get back on top. We fought every challenge and I think we really dominated the second half. It sure was exhausting running out there in the heat (it was 26 degrees but felt much hotter!), but at least it was just as gruelling for both teams. We kept a clean sheet for the second half, but unfortunately didn't score any of our own, either, which left the final scoreline at 2-0.
</p>
<p>
And thus concludes my final Wrap. Thanks to you, Porkies, for being an amazing team both on and off the field this season. And thanks for a mega-fun Newtown piss-up! Thanks to all our supporters as well - you have been great throughout the season.
</p>
<p>
I have uploaded my piccies and Drunk Hoppy Videos from the day - http://gallery.me.com/tessfromoz/100224. My dad took the match photos which is why there's so many of me! You can add your own pics to my gallery by using the links at the top, if you like. I know there are some classics out there!

<h4><a name="match-19-09">Queens Park Lions 2 (0) v (1) 1 Dunbar Rovers</a> [ 2009 Aug 16]</h4>
Dear Porkies,
<p> 
On what was probably the hottest day this winter (26 degrees!), we  
fronted up to Mission Fields for a 2pm kickoff. Our opposition were  
Dunbar, a team who had done very well throughout the league, but whom  
we had beaten comfortably the two times we faced them.
 </p>
<p>
They had certainly improved. For the first half they had us on the  
back trotter, as they dominated possession and we struggled to get any  
chances. Not long into the match, an unlucky hand ball in the area  
meant that they had a penalty chance against us. Sapanther crouched  
down and psyched the striker out, before an awesome save left the  
scoreline at 0-0. Go Sapanther! However, a corner awarded to Dunbar  
after the penalty left us Porkies exposed again, and unfortunately  
their brilliant curving corner kick resulted in the first goal of the  
match.
 </p>
<p>
At halftime, the sweltering Porkies trotted off the pitch to rest  
their bacon in the shade. We had a positive chat, and with the  
scoreline only 1-0 against us we knew we could do it.
 </p>
<p>
Fronting up to the second half, the wind and sloping ground worked in  
our favour. We regained possession and had some great chances. Before  
long, one of these paid off with a cracking kick from EK2 from way out  
- a brilliant ball that sliced across the goal and hit the far  
goalpost, only to rebound back across the face of the goal and hit the  
net. Woo! 1-1!
 </p>
<p>
We were on a streak now, and nothing Dunbar could do was going to stop  
us. We stopped them many times, though, once painfully so, as I copped  
a short-range ball into the neck and jaw. Ow! There were more  
clearances, more brilliant saves and more classy displays of football,  
but the score wouldn't budge from 1-1. Looked like we were going to go  
into extra time...
 </p>
<p>
Until the dying minutes, that is, when a Porky play at the top of the  
box left Ky with the ball. She turned, kicking the ball up and over  
everyone's heads towards the goal... and it dipped down just over the  
keeper's hands and into the goal! YES! 2-1 to the Porkies was the  
final result! Hurrah!
 </p>
<p>
Another grand final opportunity awaits us next Sunday afternoon, so  
sharpen up your trotters and let the games begin...
 </p>
<p>
Cheers<br>
Tess
 </p>
P.S: My jaw is holding up OK but I still feel like I've been punched.  
Hopefully it's better by the morning. That was a damn hard ball...

<h4><a name="match-18-09">Queens Park Lions 1 (1) v (1) 5 Maroubra United</a> [ 2009 Aug 9]</h4>
Afternoon Porkies,
<p> 
Short wrap today. Although a few people (myself included) had trouble  
finding the pitch hidden away in the trees in Centennial Park, nearly  
a full cohort of Porkies fronted up to play today's semifinal against  
Maroubra.
 </p>
<p>
The 'bra girls came out strong and we were a bit nervous in the first  
10 minutes, but didn't take long to settle into our stride. We matched  
them pace for pace as they tried to break through but couldn't make  
it. Until about halfway through the first half, when they scored the  
first goal. We fought back though, and before long we had scored one  
of our own, from the ever-classy EK1.
 </p>
<p>
The score was held 1-1 right through until about 15 minutes from the  
end of the match, when Maroubra had a sudden burst of energy and  
scored 4 - that's right, FOUR - more goals in quick succession.  
Unfortunately, that was too much to beat, and so despite our best  
efforts, the final score was 5-1 - a scoreline not at all indicative  
of the match.
 </p>
<p>
Bring on Dunbar for next week's Semi!
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess
<h4><a name="match-17-09">Queens Park Lions 3 (1) v (0) 2 Glebe</a> [ 2009 Aug 2]</h4>
Morning Porkies,
 <p>
Hope this sunny Monday morning finds you well, not too sore, bruised  
or bumped from yesterday - EK2, has your monster elbow bump gone down?
 </p>
<p>
Yesterday we fired up for a 1.30pm kick off against our old rivals,  
Glebe. Last time we played them they won by one goal, after we had  
beat them for the last 5 or so encounters. An important match, the  
winner of this one would get a place in the finals, and the loser  
would be kicked out. The pressure was on!
 </p>
<p>
And us Porkies, resplendent and Swedish in our new matching white  
headbands, came out with all guns blazing. We dominated the first few  
minutes, and this paid off early on with great team movement  
culminating in our first goal from EK1.
 </p>
<p>
Taking an early lead in the game meant that Glebe held strong for the  
rest of the half, and so the score remained 1-0 at half time.
 </p>
<p>
We expected them to be fired up for the second half, but they didn't  
seem to actually get there until near the end. Before then, we managed  
to score again with a classy shot from EK2, which sailed across the  
goal and into the top corner of the net. However, Glebe retaliated  
with a goal of their own, bring the scoreline to 2-1 - too close for  
comfort. We started to get rattled, much to Glebe's glee, but another  
goal from EK1 sealed the deal... for now.
 </p>
<p>
Glebe were really ramping it up in the dying minutes of the match, and  
they scored yet another goal which meant we were still sitting on a  
mere one point lead.
 </p>
<p>
Thankfully, though, we held tight and didn't let any more goals  
through. So the match ended 3-2, Porkies league champions (Pool B) yet  
again!
 </p>
<p>
For a while, we were cheering because this meant facing Dunbar in the  
semis. However, I got some news after the match that Dunbar beat  
Maroubra, meaning that we face Maroubra in the semis! This was a bit  
of a shock, but ultimately it means that Maroubra are beatable, so  
BRING IT ON for the semis!
 </p>
<p>
See you Tuesday night...
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess 
<h4><a name="match-16-09">Waverley Old Boys 0 (0) v (0) 1 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2009 Jul 26]</h4>
Hi all,
<p>
Welcome to the Wrap for another week. This week saw us playing Waverley Old Boys for the 3rd time, in a match that, as Dougal kept reminding us, was one of the most important of the season. Waverley finished the "main" season in 2nd place, ahead of us, but now that the points are back to zero we certainly had something to prove.
</p>
<p>
In the first half, we came out strong and stayed on top of them, not giving them any real chances. We had a couple of chances but were unfortunate that their keeper was quite good and blocked them.
</p>
<p>
Then came Alana, in front of goal with no defender. She shot it, the keeper reached up for it but fumbled and it went over her head. The keeper chased it and kicked it out of the goal, but it had already gone over the line. The (terrible) ref didn't see it that way though, and the goal was not awarded. Argh!
</p>
<p>
Another attempt on goal by Alana was foiled by the keeper, and this pissed Alana off so much that she fainted right in the middle of the pitch! Seriously, I hope you're OK Alana...
</p>
<p>
So anyway the first half ended 0-0 officially, but we really knew that it was 1-0.
</p>
<p>
In the second half, we had another couple of chances, then around halfway through Ky's throw-in was chested by Alana and then finished off by one of their players. We'll take it. 1-0!
</p>
<p>
They were getting frustrated but we had even more chances, including a shot by Vicky that missed the goal but went perfectly ("Ping!") into the net crate sitting next to the goals! Very impressive, and sad that it didn't count...
</p>
<p>
Towards the end, it was getting very physical and tough, but w held them off through more contentious decisions and frustration, and a couple of hairy chances like a free kick that sailed just over the bar... to eventually win 1-0!
</p>
<p>
Yay Porkies!
</p>
<p>
Thanks also to Em and Nina for your hospitality this evening for a BBQ and singalong. In fact, I'm not sure why I wrote this wrap, as I think we said it better in song with our Match Wrap Rap. Some of you may not have been aware, but I recorded a large portion of that, and it's now available for your downloading and listening pleasure here:

<h4><a name="match-15-09">Queens Park Lions 2 (0) v (0) 0 Pagewood</a> [ 2009 Jul 19]</h4>
Good morning Porkies!
<p> 
With the "official" season over and points reset, we had even more to  
prove in this match. Suddenly, Pagewood, one of the bottom teams, had  
a chance to reclaim a spot in the top four.
 </p>
<p>
So we came out with our best Porky trotters, a little shabby still  
from the Dougal's Friday night knees-up but nonetheless ready and  
rearing to go - to once again come head-to-head with Pagewood, easily  
the most aggressive and nasty team in our league.
 </p>
<p>
In the first half, we had way more chance than them on goal, efforts  
which were eventually rewarded with a cracking goal from Nina, who  
spun around and kicked it in a most spectacular fashion. The ball  
bounced over the keeper's head and into the goal. One for the Porkies!
 </p>
<p>
We maintained dominance after this goal, and followed it up very soon  
afterwards with a brilliant cross into the box finished off with a  
"boob shot" goal from Alana! 2-0!
 </p>
<p>
Pagewood were starting to get antsy at this stage, and their  
frustrations were starting to show. One of their players had a  
screaming match with their coach, they were screaming at each other,  
making snide remarks about us and being very physical.
 </p>
<p>
In the second half, things got much worse as their coach had a talking- 
to by the ref, EK1 clashed heads with one of their players and their  
coach, supporters and players were getting more and more frustrated.  
Though we played excellently, the score stayed 2-0 until the end.  
Another victory for Queens Parks Lions!
 </p>
<p>
It's a credit to our team that we stayed focussed and strong, for the  
large part ignoring their team falling apart. We played our own game  
and dominated the possession, the skill and certainly the team spirit.  
I was very proud to be a Porker!
 </p>
<p>
See you tomorrow night.
 </p>
Cheers<br>

Pagewood 1 (1) v (1) 4 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2009 Jul 12]</h4>
Hi Porkies,
<p>
With the weekend's frivolities dying down, it's time for the Weekend Wrap. I wish I could have pushed on with you all last night, but after reading that barrage of emails today, I'm kind of glad I didn't! Here goes...
<p>
SATURDAY
<p>
Saturday was our next clash with Loko, after our match against them was rained out. It was a beautiful day in the middle of Centennial park, and we played on probably the biggest and nicest pitch we ever had.
<p>
Our first goal came early on in the first half, with a classic EK1 goal, calmly taking on the keeper to go one goal up. Near the end of the first half though, Loko scored a freak goal that sailed over Sapanther's outstretched fingers to go into the goal. Sadly, 1-1 at half-time.
<p>
In the second half we meant business, and stormed out onto the pitch with the aim of beating them "by loads of goals" (EK2). We did our very best, and our chances and patience finally paid off when EK2 scored a fabulous header which I managed to catch on video!
<p>
Not long after this, another great header goal was scored by Cap'n Hoppy Hopkins, then Vicky pulled one out of the bag as well. Woot!
<p>
Another memorable moment in the second half was EK1's challenge of the Loko keeper, which resulted in both of the them falling to the ground, kicking wildly at the ball. EK1 decided to stay down for a little while and swing around at the ball, which was hilarious to watch. EK1 - combing talent with humour...
<p>
Porkies 4, Loko 1.
<p>

SUNDAY
<p>
We fronted up again at 8am on Sunday morning at Rowland Park to face Pagewood again - and I don't think any of us were looking forward to what could very well be another scrappy match. However, after a talking-to before kickoff by Coach Dougal, the Pagewoodians didn't seem quite as nasty as last time!
</p>
<p>
In what looked like a repeat of our last match with them, they scored first in the match. But as we know, us Porkies play better when we go one down, and this match was no exception. After a fatal fumble by their keeper, and what looked from the sidelines like a mass of kicking legs trying for goal, Nina managed to get a head in and tipped it over the keeper and into the net. Another 1-1 half-time score!
</p>
<p>
In the second half, Alana proved her ability in her new centre-pitch role by scoring her maiden goal, a calm and composed side-foot along the ground beside the keeper. Sapanther was so proud.
</p>
<p>
EK1 then shot out another of her signature bullet-balls, slamming the ball into the back of the net for yet another goal.
</p>
<p>
Not to be outdone, EK2 rounded out the match by scoring again to make the final score another 4-1 victory to the Porkettes.
</p>
<p>
So that puts us in 3rd place on the table at the end of the league matches - an excellent result, Porkies! Stay tuned for details about how the finals will be played out.

My friend from Dunbar was very pleased that they won 10-0 against Loko on Sunday! She said she thought they were really tired from Saturday's match - also they had a different keeper again. Their two strikers got 4 of the goals each. She said it was kind of ridiculous, but they kept going because they needed the goal difference. But according to the Sapanther analysis, we just scraped in by one goal! Hurrah!
</p>
<p>
See you tomorrow night.

<h4><a name="match-12-09">Glebe 2 (1) v (1) 1 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2009 Jul 4]</h4>
Hi Porkies!
<p>
Sorry, a bit late with the Wrap again this week. I ended up drinking in the afternoon yesterday and then who knows where the day went.
</p>
It certainly started off cold, though, as we bundled up our trotters and headed to Heffron for an 8am warmup. Us Porkies were the first to the pitch, and took advantage by cheekily warming up right around the centre circle. Tee hee.
<p>
The match began with a definite nervous energy, as we were facing our rivals Glebe yet again. Struggling to stay calm, we booted the ball around the pitch trying desperately to knock one into the goal. But sometimes you don't even need to try... Deans, with a huge cross from the centre line, was helped by the wind and the hard ground when her ball bounced right over the keeper and went into the net. Woo hoo! We were relieved but not complacent. Or so we thought... Glebe had different ideas, and their counterattack hit us straight back as they scored a goal of their own nearly straight away. Bugger!
</p>
<p>
The to-ing and fro-ing continued into the second half, with neither team managing to take the lead. We had a few narrowly-missed chances that left us on the sidelines squirming, but unfortunately nothing made it into the goal. And then, a shot by Glebe was only just missed by our fabulous Sapather, leaving Glebe 2-1 ahead with only 10 minutes to go. And unlike our previous showdown with them, there was no flurry of goals at the end of the match, so the final score remained Glebe 2, Porkies 1.
</p>
<p>
Nina is heading up training this Tuesday so be sure to come along! Also don't forget to send Porky Points to Amy.

Cheers<br>

<h4><a name="match-11-09">Queens Park Lions 3 (2) v (1) 0 Queens Park Rangers </a> [ 2009 Jun 28]</h4>
Hey all,
 <p>
Just got out of the shower, so it's a very clean Tess writing the wrap  
this week.
 </p>
<p>
We were all psyched up for the game this week, as it was the return of  
the local derby, versus the "other" QP team, the Rangers. Last time we  
played them tempers were on high, so we geared up for more of the same.
 </p>
<p>
Funnily enough, though, this match was a much more sedate affair, with  
good football played by both sides.
 </p>
<p>
 From the very start, we dug in deep and gave ourselves a lot of good  
chances. One of these came to fruition early on, with Nina scoring a  
goal over the keeper's head. The Return of the Kitten!
 </p>
<p>
Later in the first half, Nina scored yet another goal, with two  
Rangers players breathing down her neck. Great composure Nina!
 </p>
<p>
Meanwhile, our defensive line were holding anything back from getting  
past, with Caz and Alana in the centre in fine form, booting away any  
dangerous balls.
 </p>
<p>
The first half finished with us up 2-0, though we were not taking  
anything for granted.
 </p>
<p>
In the second half it became clear that the Rangers have a very  
different team attitude to us Porkies. Rather than constant  
encouragement, our opposition seemed to break down with every move,  
and were sniping at each other any chance they could get. This made me  
really proud of our team, and so happy that we have such amazing,  
supportive teamwork. Yay Porkies!
 </p>
<p>
Towards the end of the second half, after we had been very unlucky not  
to score from many chances on goal, EK1 came through with a superb  
shot, making our lead 3-0.
 </p>
<p>
And that's how we ended up - 13 very happy Porkies with an important  
win of 3-0! Well done girls!
 </p>
<p>
See you Tuesday for training, and I believe this week we have a second  
session on Thursday - that right, Coach?
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess<br>
 
P.S: Don't forget to send Porky Points to Amy - and congrats to this  
week's winner - Caz!
<h4><a name="match-10-09">Waverley Old Boys 2 (2) v (1) 2 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2009 Jun 7]</h4>
<p>Evening Porkies!
 </p>
<p>
Sorry the wrap is a little late this week - this is my first chance to  
sit down at my computer since the match.
 </p>
<p>
So yesterday we were little piggies in mud - literally! The constant  
rain that started a couple of hours before kickoff meant that the  
ground was nice and muddy, perfect for your sliding tackles EK2! Pity  
you couldn't make it...
 </p>
<p>
In a first, the ref came and introduced himself before the game,  
saying that since he had no linesmen he would give the benefit of  
doubt to the attacking team when it came to offside calls. We took  
this as a sign to stay deep in defence, and glad for the warning!
 </p>
<p>
Fielding a team of 11, including the injured-but-playing-against- 
doctor's-orders Sapanther, we got fired up and headed onto the pitch.  
Unfortunately, Waverley got the better of us in the first few minutes,  
scoring from a corner and over our heads.
 </p>
<p>
In typical Porky style, this early goal only led to us getting more  
fired up, and we soon scored back, with a cracker from EK1 into the  
back of the net. Yay! 1-1! This seemed to rile Waverley up even more,  
and they desperately attacked back, trying to get another goal. We  
held them at bay for the majority of the first half, even with the  
rain still pouring down and half of us covered in mud. They were  
successful in the dying minutes of the half, with a goal nearly saved  
by Sapather. Bad luck!
 </p>
<p>
The second half came, and we were more determined than ever. Nicola  
made herself unpopular to the Waverley keeper by putting the pressure  
on while she bounced the ball and took ages. She was not happy! Though  
we had a few close calls, we managed to keep a clean sheet for the  
second half, and we even got in a goal - another cheeky one by EK1.  
After playing the full match we were all tired and muddy porkies, and  
happy with a 2-2 draw against a team that had previously beaten us and  
who currently sit second on the table.
</p>
<p>
Sorry Nina, I'm not able to come on Friday night as I'm going away for  
the weekend. But I hope all Porkies are still available for Friday the  
26th for a team social at the Courthouse in Newtown!
 </p>
<p>
See you all tomorrow night.
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess


<h4><a name="match-09-09">Queens Park Lions 1 (1) v (2) 3 Pagewood</a> [ 2009 Jun 7]</h4>
Evening Porkies,
<p> 
I think we are probably all still a bit shell-shocked at the way the  
match turned out today! Certainly not what we were expecting or  
planning for. Anyway, I'll do my best to give it a round-up...
 </p>
<p>
We arrived at the match pumped and ready to play the only team we had  
left to face: Pagewood. Our first match against them was rained out so  
we were meeting them for the first time in the second round. They are  
at the bottom of the table, but the fact that we hadn't played them  
before meant that they were an unknown quantity.
 </p>
<p>
And unfortunately they got the better of us early in the first half,  
with two goals scored despite the best efforts of all, including  
Reserve Keeper Kitten Nina. They were a feisty team and quite rough,  
with many cheeky elbows in the side and loads of pushing and swearing.  
Not our style at all!
 </p>
<p>
The hairiest moment was when Vicky challenged for the ball and the  
Pagewood player knocked her down, then told her to get up and stop  
being a "pansy!" A near-punch-up ensued as both teams fired up, but it  
was avoided thanks for EK2 (and no help from the 15-year-old referee).
 </p>
<p>
This lit a fire under us, though, and we started to become more  
energised. Another round of tries on goal resulted in one successful,  
a beautifully composed shot from EK1.
 </p>
<p>
The second half finished 2-1, and we went back out on the pitch  
determined to fight back. Unfortunately, we never managed to score  
again, but Pagewood did get another sneaky goal in which Keeper Nina  
got a hand to, but sadly still went in. Final score, 3-0.
 </p>
<p>
Hard luck porkies, we played a good game but were defeated on the day.  
Let's try not to let it happen again!
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess<br>
 
P.S: Porky Points to Amy please!<br>
 
P. P.S: I showed these around today but wanted to confirm that the  
price for the Porky Pins will be $3.50 each. Is this something  
everyone is willing to buy? Please let me know ASAP so I can order them.
 <br>
P.P.P.S: Social night planned for the 26th of June, meeting in the  
Courthouse in Newtown (Australia St) at 7pm ish. They have food there.  
We'd like to book a table so if you could get back with tentative yay/ 
nay that would be great.

<h4><a name="match-08-09">Maroubra United 6 (3) v (0) 1 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2009 May 31]</h4>

Dear Porkies,
<p> 
Big match today - playing against the top of the table, the undefeated  
Maroubra. The team that has been playing together for 8 years,  
apparently?!?) The team that beat us 4-0 last time we played them.
 </p>
<p>
Despite the last-minute change in match start time, we were all  
rearing and ready to go for a 3pm kickoff at Coral Sea. The air was a  
bit chilly but after a warm up we trotted out onto the pitch and  
prepared ourselves for the game.
 </p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Maroubra got an early lead with a goal in the first few  
minutes. We held tight and held them off scoring again for awhile,  
playing well and managing to keep possession for a fair amount of  
time, but they managed to get another two goals in before half time.  
The half time score of 3-0 did not do our game justice, though, as we  
had played well and maintained possession for a good portion of the  
half - just had some unlucky shots that didn't make it into the net.
 </p>
<p>
Having an "unofficial" ref from the Maroubra side didn't help either,  
as many of their offside advantages went uncalled, and our defence  
were constantly struggling to keep up with their nippy strikers.
 </p>
<p>
The goal just before the end of the first half was accompanied by  
Sapanther twisting her ankle and going down for the count - carried  
off, there was nothing to do but for Deans to take the gloves for the  
second half.
 </p>
<p>
The second half didn't prove much better for us, though, as Maroubra  
scored another 3 goals against us. Thankfully, we did get a goal in -  
a fabulous cross from Nicola finished off by a cheeky header over the  
keeper's head from EK1. We also had a lot of chances in the second  
half, and many moments of good football - we were very unlucky that  
our conversion percentage was just not as high as Maroubra.
 </p>
<p>
The general consensus was that the final score of 6-1 was not  
indicative of the quality of game that we played - and that you can't  
win them all!
 </p>
<p>
Don't forget to send your points in to Amy - not me!
 </p>
See you all on Tuesday.
 <br>
Cheers<br>
Tess
<h4><a name="match-07-09">Queens Park Lions 4 (3) v (1) 1 Dunbar Rovers</a> [ 2009 May 24]</h4>
<p>
Welcome to the Sunday Wrap!
 </p>
<p>
A special welcome to Jules to the match wrap! Sorry, took me awhile to  
realise you weren't getting them! Oops...
 </p>
<p>
Today was a big match, as we faced up to Dunbar for the second time to  
mark the beginning of the second round of matches. Last time we faced  
them we walked away with a 4-0 win, but they have been having some  
great results since then so it was hard to know what to expect.
 </p>
<p>
Dunbar started out disappointingly flat. But in true Porky fashion, we  
came out with all guns blazing, taking three goals early in the first  
half! First up was EK1, with a typically sneaky ball rolling past the  
keeper and into the net. Second to score was EK2, with a signature  
cross from the left sailing past the keeper and into the goal. Third  
was Jules, with a stunning half-pitch unmarked run, followed up by a  
composed maiden goal to make the scoreline 3-0.
 </p>
<p>
This lit a fire under Dunbar, and they started to fight back,  
resulting in a goal scored over Sapather's head. So we trotted off the  
pitch, 3-1 at halftime.
 </p>
<p>
The second half began, and Dunbar were hungry to chalk up some more  
goals. We stayed calm and played to feet, and after a few chances Ky  
was the one to slam the ball home for us - our fourth goal! By this  
point we were riding high and nothing could shake us. We stayed close  
and tight in defense and denied any further goals, finishing the match  
at 4-1. Well done Porkies!
 </p>
<p>
We want to organise a porky social night soon and will take votes on  
which date. A Friday night is usually best to minimise match-day  
hangovers, and we were thinking either June 5 or 26th? Does anyone  
have a preference for either of those dates?
 </p>
Cheers<br>
Tess<br>
 
P.S: Please make sure to send your player's player points (Jules -  
that's 3 people to choose for 1 point, 2 points and 3 points) to Amy - amylou1979@hotmail.com 


<h4><a name="match-06-09">Queens Park Lions 3 (2) v (1) 2 Glebe</a> [ 2009 May 17]</h4>
Morning Porkies,
<p> 
I was so exhausted last night I couldn't lift my fingers to type! So  
the wrap is coming to you now...
</p>
<p> 
Yesterday was a beautiful day for a football match! We were set to  
play Glebe, a bit of a grudge match after last season's multiple  
showdowns with them.
 </p>
<p>
The game started quite evenly, with neither team getting any chances  
and both holding tight. But before too long, one of their fast  
strikers broke through our line of defence, and booted the ball past  
Sapanther to score the first goal. This lit a fire under us, and we  
were more determined than ever. We hit back, dominating the next few  
minutes of the goal and trying everything we could to score. Our hard  
efforts paid off, as a post-half-marathon EK2 booted a cross from the  
left side that sailed past their keeper and ended up in the goal! Woo  
hoo! 1-1!
 </p>
<p>
We were chuffed to equalise, but still determined to create a lead.  
Before the end of the first half, a solid play led to EK1 powering  
through the box, ready to strike when a Glebe player took her out with  
a very physical tackle. This led to a penalty being awarded, and EK1  
slid the ball in next to their keeper for a one-point lead - ending  
the half 2-1.
 </p>
<p>
Half-time talk was positive but we went back onto the pitch knowing  
that Glebe would come out "with guns blazing," according to Dougal. He  
was not wrong, and they began the half with intense pressure on our  
defence. We held strong, though, and after a few tries and rebounds  
EK1 took a strike which again sailed past the keeper.
 </p>
<p>
Now the scoreline was 3-1, Glebe were even more hungry for a goal,  
which they achieved soon after our goal from one of their wingers  
outrunning me and shooting a goal over Sapather's head.
 </p>
<p>
Trailing by one point only served to make Glebe fight harder to  
equalise. They attacked us hard, but we held the defensive fort  
strong, and even tried to score again with a brilliant cross from EK2  
followed up by a promising header from Hoppy Hopkins, which  
unfortunately rose up and over the crossbar. A yellow card to Glebe  
for swearing and a few dud throw-ins displayed their nervousness and  
speed, and the last few minutes of the match were utter madness.
 </p>
<p>
We held on, though, and the match finished up 3-2, another victory  
chalked up to the Red and Blacks!
 </p>
<p>
Good job, Porkies! Way to show our old nemeses what our new team can do!
 </p>
<p>
As always, don't forget to send your Porky Points to Amy. See you all  
on Tuesday night.
 </p>

<h4><a name="match-05-09">Queens Park Rangers 2 (1) v (3) 4 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2009 May 10]</h4>
<p>
Hey Porkies!
 </p>
<p>
Bit late on the wrap this week as I had to do the Mother's Day thing  
last night. Hope everyone had a great evening at the pub after the  
match!
 </p>
<p>
... and what a match...
 </p>
<p>
Us Porkies rocked up at the pitch yesterday determined to win the  
local derby, against the Queens Park Rangers. Wearing our white away  
strip was a little different, but with a slight change to the team  
song lyrics we were on our way.
 </p>
<p>
We had a strong start to the match, with our first goal being scored  
by a very composed PC Deans. Soon after, Captain K Hoppy took a free  
kick from outside the box which sailed over everyone's heads, curling  
back over the keeper to land in the top of the net. Brilliant!
 </p>
<p>
The Reds started to show their frustration, and the combination of  
their bench's slagging matches with the Ref and a few of the players'  
sly comments to us Whites did not make their team look good. Credit to  
the Porkies though, we didn't get drawn into their bickering, and  
played the game with good sportspigship as usual.
 </p>
<p>
Before long, a third goal was scored by EK1 from a smashing corner by  
EK2 - truly a great display of the EKs working together. Unfortunately  
though, the Reds soon scored their own goal from a fast break that got  
the better of our defence.
 </p>
<p>
So we finished the first half at 3-1, feeling positive but still very  
aware that it wasn't over.
 </p>
<p>
Second half, and we trotted back onto the pitch with a strong start.  
However... I think I truly deserve the "Doofus of the Match" award for  
handling the Red's shot on goal just centimetres before it crossed the  
goal line, meaning that Sam had to face up to a penalty but I luckily  
escaped a booking. Unfortunately, the penalty went in, narrowing our  
lead to just one goal at 3-2.
 </p>
<p>
The excitement ramped up and we were all jittery, spurred on by crazy  
calls from the Ref (who was clearly just trying to keep a lid on the  
increasingly volatile situation!). Tempers were boiling and their #27  
screamed (literally) around the pitch like a tornado, knocking over  
everyone in her path.
 </p>
<p>
Soon though, even with a fuzzy jet-lagged head EK1 scored another  
brilliant goal, giving us a bit of breathing space at 4-2. However,  
the Ref's crazy calls were increasing, and a contentious penalty was  
called against us for obstruction in the box. Even after the penalty- 
taker's elaborate stretching, primping and preening, she missed the  
penalty, with the ball rebounding off the crossbar and being cleared  
away by our defence.
 </p>
<p>
It was difficult to remain level-headed against the other Queens Park  
team, but we emerged as the better team on the day and were victorious  
at 4-2. Well done, Porkies!
 </p>
Tess

<h4><a name="match-04-09">Queens Park Lions 1 (0) v (0) 0 Lokomotiv Cove</a> [ 2009 May 3]</h4>

Hey Porkies,
 <p>
Live wrapping again from the Paddo Arms, which is buzzing with QPFC  
teams after their matches.
 </p>
<p>
And the Porkies are victorious! But I'm jumping ahead, so let's start  
at the start...
 </p>
<p>
Despite the torrential downpour last night, it was clear blue skies  
when we go to the pitch. I even spotted a rainbow! The air was a  
little humid and the sun was in our eyes, but our 11-person squad  
knuckled down for the first half.
 </p>
<p>
Loco came out quite strong, but we matched their every move and ended  
up dominating the first half, keepng the ball in their half and  
controlling all their loose balls. Unfortunately though, we couldn't  
convert our determination to a goal, even after a few chances  
(including Caz's notable run and strike!). We had a referee and two  
linespeople, though the ref was lacking in the observation department.  
this did not go unchecked by Dougal, who clocked up a notification  
from the ref for telling him to watch his linesman's call!
 </p>
<p>
Half-time match talk was very positive, with an encouragement to be  
more determined and keep it up in the second half.
 </p>
<p>
Finally, that determination and patience paid off, and EK2's sterling  
corner was whacked into the goal by Ky.
 </p>
<p>
Not to be caught on the back trotter, we held on til the very end, not  
letting anything through although we were all exhausted after playing  
90 minutes.
</p>
<p> 
Everyone did a great job today, and we should be very happy piggies!  
We deserved our 1-0 victory and we can to even better next time we  
meet them.
 </p>
<p>
That's that for this week, as I need to be more social and keep  
drinking my beer!
 </p>
<p>
See you all at training on Tuesday, and don't forget to send your  
players player points to Amy!
 </p>
Cheers<br />

<h4><a name="match-03-09">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (0) 1 Waverley Old Boys</a> [ 2009 Apr 26 ]</h4>

Hi Porkies!
<p> 
Well, this morning's start was slightly early, but the sun was out and  
the wind was fresh, and it was time to play football! While some  
little piggies were nursing hangovers, some had spent last night wee- 
wee-wee allll the way home (sorry).
 </p>
<p>
After dressing what we hoped was the right pitch, Couch Dougal led us  
through the usual warm-up, then we prepared for our battle against  
Waverley Old Boys. The wind was picking up pace, making it a challenge  
to predict where our balls would land.
 </p>
<p>
The first half started out a little slow, as we were still waking up  
and rubbing our eyes in the light. Waverley appeared to dominate,  
holding the ball in our half for most of the time. They had some  
skilled players and solid passing, but we managed to keep them at bay  
and hold the score at 0-0 at half-time.
 </p>
<p>
Our half-time talk consisted of a rally to up the energy and the  
assertiveness, and power on into the second half. Which we did, with  
heads held high and determination to chalk up a point or two on the  
scoreboard.
 </p>
<p>
Alas, we were not to be successful this time, with a controversial  
goal scored by one of their players, who looked to be very much off- 
side. Sam readied herself at the goal and the Waverley player bore  
down on her and only just scraped in a goal.
 </p>
<p>
In true Porky spirit, not to be defeated, we perked up and tried  
desperately to win back a point. But despite several cracking  
attempts, we walked away with a 1-0 loss at the final whistle.
 </p>
<p>
I can't speak for the after-match festivities, as I had to leave, but  
I hope that the pub trip lifted spirits after a challenging battle.
 </p>
<p>
As always, please remember to send through your Porky Points to Amy (amylou1979@hotmail.com

 </p>
See you Tuesday!<br>

<h4><a name="match-02-09">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (4) 4 Maroubra United</a> [ 2009 Apr 5 ]</h4>
Hey Porkies!
<p> 
Tess here. Actually I'm still sitting in the pub, trying out what I'm  
calling "live wrapping," direct from the game after-party to you.
 </p>
<p>
It was a tough match today, with 3 Porkies injured and another 4 away.  
So it was up to the remaining 9 Porkies, along with some very nice O35  
players to make up the numbers, to bring home the bacon.
 </p>
<p>
It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Queens Park, and though I was  
one of the injured on the bench I could still feel the team spirit. We  
were playing Maroubra, a different side to last season though and  
largely made up of young, energetic and skilful players.

<p>
Unfortunately, we conceeded a goal less than halfway through the first  
half, which was followed in quick succession by three more. The quick  
passing of Maroubra meant that once they were on a roll, they were  
difficult to stop.
 </p>
<p>
Karla went down near the end of the first half, pushed in the back by  
a Maroubra defender in the box. Unfortunately though, our penalty was  
not converted and we finished the first half 4-0 down.
 </p>
<p>
The half-time chat was focussed on team spirit, I think we are really  
missing Sandy Pants when it comes to calling out on the pitch!
 </p>
<p>
The talk worked though, as we dominated the second half and had a fair  
few chances on goal, only narrowly missing out on scoring. The team  
had their heads up, and denied any further goals from Maroubra. We  
played great in the second half and really demonstrated our skill as a  
force to be reckoned with! Final score was 4-0 to Maroubra.
 </p>
<p>
It was an exciting match to watch from the sidelines, but I am really  
missing being on the pitch - I'll be back next time!!
 </p>
<p>
Please send your players player points to Amy as per usual, and see  
you at training on Tuesday!

       <h4><a name="match-01-09">Dunbar Rovers 0 (0) v (2) 4 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2009 Mar 29 ]</h4>
        <p>
        Welcome back or welcome to Queens Park Season 2009!
	  </p>
 	  <p>
        For those of you who are new to the QP team, each week for the past few seasons I have summed up our match with the 'Sunday Wrap'. Happily I write the first two for the season, but I will admit I have passed the job onto my 2008 sub, Tessa who will do a wonderful job and I will 'fill-in' when she needs me. I thought it was time to let someone else take the reins and plus, I'm sure that you are all sick of reading my style by now!
	  </p>
	  <p>So here goes..</p>
	  <p>
	  A beautiful day, an enthusiastic bunch of footballers and one very excited coach, what a fabulous recipe for a successful start to the 2009 season.
        </p>
 	  <p>At 11am, QP Lions took to the pitch (looking pretty spiffy in their new kits) summonsed by a ref and a linesboy, haha (yes, you read correctly, we had officials!). Nervous giggles were soon put to rest as the first whistle of the season blew and it wasn't long (5 minutes in fact) before new recruit Nina scored our first goal. At the 25-minute mark, Emma K scored left footed (thanks for the info Vick) to make many little piggies squeal with delight.
	  The 2-0 score at half time was comforting although Coach Dougal reminded us all that the game was far from over and managed to squeeze in a few negative (and positive) notes to keep the Porkies on their trotters.
	  </p>
        <p> 
	  The second half kicked off with Anita moving from defence into attack and that she did with a super goal. With the unrelenting weather getting hotter and hotter the game was taken to another level when another of our new teammates Emma Kirkaldy (aka Kirky/EK2) went round the Dunbar keeper and put the ball in the back of the opposition's net with graceful composure and ease.
        </p>
	  <p> 
	  The final whistle blew with the scoreboard showing an impressive 4-0 result for the first game of the season. A gallant effort from all involved and the celebrations continued (in true Porky fashion) with a bevy and a bite at the Paddo Arms, which was a nice way to 'kick of the season'.	
	  </p>
 	  <p>And if you're still reading, I will quickly explain 'The Queen's Porker' and how he came about. A few years ago, we found out that 2 QP teams were in the same comp (as is the case again this year) and in an effort to come up with a name to differentiate between the two, Coach Dougal thought that it would be rather hysterical if we changed our name to 'Queens Pork, although we didn't find it quite as funny, it sort of stuck and we ended up with a 'players player' trophy known as the 'The Queen's Porker' or the Porky Award!
	  </p>
	  <p>So this is the part you need to think about� each week you need to email me your 'players player' points for the match just played. You need to award 3 people in the team points (3 points, 2 points and 1 point) no need to give an explanation why, just tell me who gets what and I will tally them up. The following Sunday, I will announce the previous weeks winners, the person with the most points for the week gets to keep 'The Porky' trophy for the week. No need to stress about it, I will send an email to remind you (please don't reply all).
	  </p>
	   <p>So thanks for your time, it's great to be back running about with you all.</p>
	  <p>
  	  Have a great week
	  </p>
	  <p>

	  Sandra, Percy was most pleased when I got home and told him the news, he listened most attentively as he munched on his little treat of lovely, leafy bok choy to celebrate the win!
