        <h2>Queens Park Lions' match Reports 2012</h2>
		<h4><a name="match-19-12">Coogee Utd 4 (3) v (1) 2 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2012 Aug 19]</h4>
		With Porkies second year in Division 1 and two teams coming across from the North West league, making it stronger, the Porkies yet again excelled, finishing second (again) in the league, beating the league winners "Dumbo" Rovers two out of three meetings and in the semi-final too....and reaching ANOTHER Grand-Final. Impressive? Absolutely!
<p>
Playing Coogee United at Heffron 4 (first year not to play in a stadium), we were quietly confident. Unfortunately a lot didn't go our way and we were left high and dry after 90 minutes of very physical football.
</p>
<p>
Coogee Utd came out strong and we were on the defense for the first 15 minutes. Unfortunately the referee, who wasn't wearing just black but the same strip as Coogee
Utd (black AND white), matchingly, blew his black AND white whistle for a penalty? It was a shot which rifled into the body/arm of our talented beloved trotter Chloe-NATOR. Gutted. Not fair. Wasn't a penalty! Why us?
</p>
<p>
Goooooooooal, Deano had no chance and Coogee Utd took a very important psychological lead. The game was frantic and The Porkies were getting bashed around a bit. The Coogee crowd were loud and confident, particularly William Bruce; he had the freedom to roam up and down the lines but I soon took his FREEDOM away! The next goal came from Coogee Utd. 2-0 down with 15 minutes left of the first half. We needed something....
</p>
<p>
And we got it! A thunderous goal from joint Golden boot winner (and potty trained) Lyndsey Lohan! Hits the roof of the net and The Porkies
were back in business with our 50 strong supporters ALIVE!
</p>
<p>
With 5 minutes to go, we wanted to hold onto this 2-1 deficit going into half time, cause we knew we could flatten them in second half. We did. With a confident run from
No. 8, who was everywhere (including in the pub afterwards, mmmmm), ran at our midfield and DIVED just outside our area. With not a graze in sight,  the black AND white clothed ref gave Coogee Utd a free-kick on the cusp of half-time. Dangerous? We didn't think so....
</p>
<p>
Until No.7 stepped up and curled it right to left into the top left hand corner (see picture attached). Silence from the red and black. The black AND white whistle was once again blown but this time for half-time. We were all very down troden Porkies. 3-1 after 45 minutes - we just did not expect this. 2-1 we were in it. 3-1 we were....lost for words.
</p>
<p>
Half-time mood was difficult to lift. Even Sophia's pom-poms were not to cheer the sombre couch and Porkies.
</p>
<p>
We needed an early goal in the second half but unfortunately this didn't come. Being a final, chances were fewer. We pressed and tried but scuppered a handful of chances. Sitting on top of Coogee for quite some time we eventually broke them down with a goal from our other Golden boot legend, Emma "Griffin saver". 3-2!! Collecting the ball out of the back of the net we seriously had a chance!!! The Porky supporters were in a frenzy. William Bruce was well backin his corner and Sophia's pom-poms were working!
</p>
<p>
More chances went astray but credit to the Coogee keeper - she was in-form.
</p>
<p>
Minutes went back, the Sun was fast disappearing and so were our dreams of becoming AAW1 GF winners - Coogee Utd were next to score and The Porkies were down and out. 4-2.
</p>
<p>
With the whistle blowing, that "fortune was hiding" once again for The Porkies. The loss was so hard to take, with only 12 of our 15 magical Porkies there, we collected our medals, sportingly applauded Coogee Utd, who we'd now lost to twice and beaten twice in the Season.
</p>
<p>
We trotted off to The Clovelly Hotel to drown our sorrows.
</p>
<p>
Of course, in true Porky spirit we drank the bar and our Esky dry and feasted on Porky sausages, chops and ribs at Couch / V and Sophia's the following day.
</p>
<p>
Everyone, it's been a fantastic year. Next year will be our third year in Division 1 next year - I'm excited already!
</p>
<p>
Keep in touch girls.
</p>
Love and live forever,<br>
Dougal / Couch / Trigger.
PS See you all on Friday 7th at The Coogee Palace for the QP club presentation.
		
		<h4><a name="match-18-12">Dunbar Rovers 2 (1) v (1) 2 Queens Park Lions (4-5 on penalties)</a> [ 2012 Aug 5 ]</h4>
		Hi Porkies!!!!!!!!!
<p>
While our beloved Porky-tastic wrapper "Aly Aly Aly, Oi Oi Oi" dons a wedding dress (not white!) and fuels up on some Yankee-doodle deeing, our Porkies were in action on Sunday 5th.
</p>
<p>
Playing at Heffron, pitch 55 - our home ground in 2011, the Porkies trotted in from near and far from all random directions (Heffron is huuuuge and very confusing for us all), to take on Dumbo Rovers for third time in 5 weeks. With the league over, it was Cup time for the top four teams in AAW1, Eastern Suburbs, Sydney, 'stralia. Prior to our game Coogee Utd beat Waverley Old Bandits so would be facing the loser of our semi-final. Exciting!!!
</p>
<p>
This epic match lasted 90 minutes + 30 minutes extra time + a penalty shoot out. Oh yes, a penalty shoot out - the first in the history of the Porkies!
</p>
<p>
Although we chased the scoreline, like a squealing piglet chasing it's tail, for 75 odd minutes, we always looked in control (I wouldn't dare be biased..would I?). Newly named "Dumbo Rover" aka Dunbar Rovers, scored first; their prolific attacking midfielder/forward Sandra, drove one through the slippery hands of our mighty Deano in goal, over her head. Immediately coming back strong we superfluously slipped into third gear and showed 'em how to play. Not surprisingly we equalised with a guided curved shot from our Captain "Griffin Saver", onto the inside of the post, from inside the area. 1-1 and we were looking confident.
</p>
<p>
Second half, Deano had back troubles, so was rested but up for cheering!!! Being replaced by AAW3 keeper,Tory, and AAW3 Leah trotted into her now familiar position, right back - both players had already played so were warmed up  and mad for it! Little did they know that they were going to be part of one of the THE greatest games for the Porkies.
</p>
<p>
The referee, as always played an "integral" part of our game (sigh)....his fitness was of main concern to everyone and whether HE could actually last 90 minutes, let alone extra time but being firmly planted in the center spot reassured us all he could....minutes went by in the second half and the "rooted" ref blows for a PENALTY! Carnage. Bedlam. Nuts. Crap. They step up, strike it low with force..... and Tory makes her first mark to the game - she goes down and SAVES!!! We're in the clear and the spirits are even higher, go The Porkies!!!!....
</p>
<p>
But low and behold, the ref, now 60 odd minutes into the game and just about breaking into a sweat, awards another penalty to DR. Silence. We weren't happy. Could Tory save us again?...
</p>
<p>
Sandra Elaphant rocks up aaaaaand BOOM, she rips the ball into the net, 2-1 to the greyed trunk buffoons. Welsh's finest football coach " Mr.Troll", pops out of his hole and jumps for joy, a little too close to Couch Douglas. Dislike very much. The ref starts to pickup on Dumbo's filthy ways and gave us free-kicks a plenty - he even booked a Dumbo player!....perhaps it was "Nelly" and possibly should have packed her trunk!!!??....with 15 minutes or so to go, the ref blows (from the center half) for a ANOTHER PENALTY....but this time for the Porkies!!!! Wow. Our very own newly potty trained Lyndsey Lohan stepped up and showed the Dumbos how to take a penalty and almost rips a hole in the net. 2-2. GAME ON!!!
</p>
<p>
and what a game, with numerous chances for us (of course), we went into extra time knowing we could finish them off with a Golden Goal. Tory was strong and didn't have much to do, but that was going to change. Our chances went a miss, lacking far post runs for a number of tap ins. A few long shots went narrowly wide but the ref blew for end of extra time.
</p>
<p>
Oh Oh.
</p>
<p>
We'd never been in this position before; PENALTY shoot out. For the first time ever I'd not got the girls to practice taking penalties in training too!....anyway I had 5 confident Porkies happy to step up. How good is that. Ordering was a little tricky though so Captain "Griffin Saver" was pushed into going first.
</p>
<p>
With the full squad of Porkies (minus "two left boots" Sonja), we all watched anon as a "Not Nelly" the Elephant stepped up for DR and scored. Quite convincing. Were we worried? Never! Captain "Griffin saver" trotted up to the spot. BOOOM, the cross bar rattles and we hear a cry from the heard of Elephants (and Troll), again, a little too close to us. They score their second. 2-0. Oh dear. Next up Lyndsey L and she SCORES! We're on the board and we're still fighting!! Tory, Deano's stunt double is up again, looking stealthily at the Dumbo player - she saves, CARNAGE for a few seconds!!!!!!!!!!! 2-1 down still, we had to score. Next up, "Ronnie Size and Reprasentz" and  within a second RSR scores - it's 2-2 with two to play and The Porkies have found their squealing voices again. They score their third. 3-2. Next up for QP is new season signing Peta Rabbit!!! There was deadly silence; the pressure was insurmountable. The keeper gets a hand to it but GOAAAAAAAAL and The Rabbit and Piglets jump for joy!!!! 3-3. Next up was the same Dumbo, who had missed in the second half; I guess she wanted to prove she hadn't let her team down in the 90 minutes. Very brave.....BUT Tory puts in another solid save!!!!!!!!!!....Oh boy, we cheered hard AND realised we could win on penalties if our very own Banana girl, Blonde Alex could score?!?.....and did she?????
</p>
<p>
OF COURSE SHE DID, WE HAD WON ON PENALTIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We all trotted to Alex, including our injured/pregnant players, formed a solid circle and bellowed the MIGHTY QUEENS PARK SONG (the song still lives on, thanks Nic!).
</p>
<p>
And that's that. We were through to the final and we'd now beaten Dumbo Rovers 3 out of 4 times this season. Sadly we din;t win the the league but our Grand Final is on Sunday 19th at 1pm (venue TBA), where we face Coogee United who sunk the deflated Dumbos 2-0 yesterday. The Porkies are on cloud nine but it's back to our pens, mud and business on Sunday.
</p>
<p>
Over and out,<br>

PS Team Porky 2012: See you Thursday night at 7.15pm for our last training session in 2012!!!    
		<h4><a name="match-17-12">Queens Park Lions  2 (1) v (1) 1 Dunbar Rovers</a> [ 2012 Jul 29 ]</h4>
		Hola Porky people!
 <p>
Can you believe the season is already at a close?  This Sunday we played our final league game against our biggest rivals, the Dunbar Rovers, at their home ground of NCIE.
 </p>
 <p>
And it was most victorious!
 </p>
 <p>
With a lean squad, only 1.5 subs (Chloe is fighting an ankle injury) we defeated our foes not 2, not 3, not 4, but 5-1!
 </p>
 <p>
It all started when Gill scored a cool, composed goal from the top of the box into the back centre of the net.  We played most of the first half on Dunbar's side, but they got a breakaway and a super-speedy forward sunk one on us to even up the score.
 </p>
 <p>
Hard-working Emma G soon returned the favour twice over, following by a fourth goal by Aly.
 </p>
At half time we were feeling great and went into the second 45 determined to keep up the good work!  Dunbar came back fighting and the play went from one side of the feild to the other.  Jen, Gill, Emma G, Aly, Lyndsay, and Alex H played with ferocity up front, while Leah, Alana, Peta, Caz, Sonja, and Deans held all the attacks at bay. 
 </p>
 <p>
Toward the end of  the second half Emma fed a great through ball into the box for Aly to chip into the net, making the final score of 5-1.
 </p>
<p>
And so 13 happy Porkies, 1 happy Couch, and Sophia sang our victory song!
</p>
<p> 
For those that don't know it (since we are going to need it for finals) here is a refresher:
 </p>
 <p>
Who's that team in the red and black?<br>
Mighty Mighty Queens Park<br>
From Defense into Attack<br>
Mighty Mighty Queens Park<br>
Talkin Bout Mighty (Mighty!) Mighty (Mighty!)<br>
Mighty Mighty Queens Park<br>
Shout out Queens Park thats our name<br>
WE JUST WON THIS GAME!<br>
 <p>
Cheers,<br>

		<h4><a name="match-16-12">Coogee Utd 2 (1) v (3) 6 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2012 Jul 22 ]</h4>
            Hello Porky People!
 <p>
It was a very early start for the ladies in red on Sunday for our 9am game against the Clammy Coogees at Heffron Park.  The day started out rainy and cold but soon cleared up for the kick-off.
 </p>
 <p>
The lovely Leah was in attendance again to help our very lean team - with Dirty Deans in the back; Caz, Alana, Peta, and Leah in the back; Sonja, Aly, Chloe, and Lyndsay in the middle; and Alex Hacket, Emma G, and Emma C playing both forward and middle throughout the game.
 </p>
 <p>
We started off with a BANG when Alex Hacket scored on a cross and shot in the box!  The positive energy on the field soared, but unfortunately so did a Coogee shot... into the back of our net.  Oh no, tied game!
 </p>
 <p>
After a scrappy few minutes the play settled decidedly in Coogee's half and we rained shot after shot on their keeper, finally getting through when Lyndsay pinged an unstoppable shot low into the left hand corner through the fray. 
 </p>
 <p>
Half time, 2-1 QP!  Dougal, Sophia, and the Porkys were pumped!  We were determined to lengthen the lead and show Coogee who the superior team is.
 </p>
 <p>
In the final 45 history repeated itself when Alex Hacket scored another beauty which was unfortunately returned by a score from Coogee.  3-2 to the Porkies! 
 </p>
 <p>
Our fitness, skill, and determination paid off when Emma G got two in a row - one a hard-earned shot outside the box and another a beautiful run past the defense, 1v against the keeper, and easy pass into the goal. 
 </p>
 <p>
Emma C made the final goal, well-earned after several close attempts, to bring us home at 6-2 vs the Coogee Clams. 
 </p>
 <p>
We all happily trotted off the feild and sang our victory song - then went back to bed!!!
 </p>
 <p>
Stay tuned for our next game, a make-up against Dunbar!
 </p>
Porky love,<br>
Aly

		<h4><a name="match-14-12">Queens Park Lions 2 (1) v (2) 3 Coogee United</a> [ 2012 Jul 8]</h4>
		Hola Porklets!
 <p<>
Apologies for the lack of wraps this week, this little piggy's Director is in town :)
 </p>
 <p>
Here is the news:
 </p>
<p>Queens Park vs Coggee Clams, 8/7/12
 </p>
 <p>
It was with a team of 9 that the Porkies attempted to defeat the Cranky Clams at our home pitch of Queens Park 28 at (yup you guessed it) 3pm on Sunday.  The ever-talented Lyndsay started on goal until, thankfully we were joined by Ellen and Jen fresh from their own game!  Unfortunately Coggee nabbed a quick goal off of a deadly corner kick making the score 0-1.  An unlucky penalty in the box gifted Coogee with a second, and the Porkies pushed into panic mode!!  Soon after we received a penalty in the box and Lyndsay sunk the shot! 
 </p>
 <p>
Half-time... eek!  Dougal and the Porkies knew we weren't having our best game, but came out swinging in the second half.
 </p>
 <p>
Again, Coggee got a free kick outside of our box and got the direct shot into the back of the net.  Soon after Emma G (I think??) planted a great shot from outside the box to tie the score!  The final twenty minutes of the game was frantic, with Porky shots raining down on the Coggee keeper but the ball just wasn't bouncing our way.  Sonja had a great shot that bounced off the post, Emma G and Emma C both had attacks in the box that bounced just shy of the corner post. 
 </p>
 <p>
At full-time the score stood at 2-3, to the Coogee Clams.  Not a happy bunch of Porkies!  That's okay, we still have one more shot at showing them good soccer next week!
 </p>
 <p>
Queens Park vs Dunbar Rovers 15/7/12
 </p>
 <p>
We happily had a full team, and even a few subs (thank you to Leah from the over 35s who had a cracking game!) for this final in-season match against our nemesis, the Dunbar Rovers, played on the beautiful grounds at NCIE.  This game was innnntense!  The first ten minutes seemed to take the Porky Players by surprise, with the ball bouncing around and not making it to red trotters, but soon we settled down and played great soccer!  Dunbar proceeded with their normal game, attacking with long serves and physical play.  Not outdone at all, QP was the first to score... (was is Emma G??) and we tasted sweet sweet victory as Dunbar learned what is was like to be down a point for the first time this season on their home turf!!!
All too soon Dunbar came back to even the score and at half time Dougal had lots of positive things to say.  Everyone had their heads in the game and we trotted back on to finish with a positive result.
 </p>
 <p>
The last half was very tense, with a few hard hits and heavy injuries.  The Porkies had the run of the play but Dunbar had a few very scary attacks as well.  Toward the second part of the half an attack started from the mid field (was is Sonja or Chloe?) who got the ball to (I think Emma G?), who took the ball into the right corner and pass back to Lyndsay, who faked a few defenders out and shot...and scored!  We had a big team hug and ran back to half feild to finish the game.
 </p>
 <p>
And so Dunbar has finally been defeated by the Mighty Might Queens Park, 2-1!  Everyone had a great game and we had supporters Vicki and Nicola (Hoppy) as well as their little porklets!
 </p>
 <p>
Stay tuned for next week (I promise I will write one on time!) when Queens Park plays Coggee to even the score!
 </p>
Cheers,<br>

		<h4><a name="match-13-12">Waverley Old Boys 1 (0) v (2) 2 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2012 Jul 1]</h4>
		Happy Monday!
 <p>
Yesterday the Porkies earned a fantastic result in our third round against the Waverley Oldies, with the help of Ellen and Jen from the QP2s, BIG thank you to both.
 </p>
 <p>
With a gaggle of girls away from Sydney and/or injured we had a squad of 9 to start the game, so with the addition of Ellen and Jen we had a full squad, only just.  Jen saved the day for us by playing goalkeeper and our back line consisted of Ellen, Alana, Caz, and Sonja.  In the midfield was Aly, Chloe, Lyndsay, Emma C, and up top Emma G and Alex.  Gentle Gill came to support, and subsequently play after half-time, where she rocked the midfield!
 </p>
 <p>
The girls made a big statement when, ten minutes after kick-off, Emma G received the ball at the top of the box to fake out the left defender and sink the ball into the lower left corner.  Boom.
 </p>
 <p>
The gals continued to show Waverley a strong and united front, sending several well-formed attacks at Waverley Defense and earning a fair few corners and shots on goal.  Emma G's hard work paid off yet again when she scored a second goal midway through the first half, placing QP at a tenuous lead over the Oldies on their home-turf at Moore Park. 
 </p>
 <p>
In the second half Waverley came out swinging (almost literally) and gave our squad a run for our money!  Unfortunately they were able to land one in our net from a near-unstoppable shot from the penalty spot.  At one point Waverley received about 20 minutes straight of free kicks on our side of the field - it seemed as if someone slipped the ref a 20 before the game!  Despite this, the score remained 2-1 and Jen had some A-mazing saves, in particular a 1v1 against a Waverley forward who shot low to the right.  Jen saved the shot with a quick lunge and stop with her left foot and quick catch of the rebound.  The crowd (Dougal) went wild!  Ellen sacrificed her body for the team and was a solid defender, clearing the ball to our forwards to run on to.  Everyone had a truly fantastic game and all seemed to be going well until, on one play Emma G was taken out on a late hit and the offending player received a yellow.  Thankfully, Gill, despite being sick, subbed in and we finished the game battling with Waverley until the final whistle!
 </p>
 <p>
In the end, the Porky Victory Song resounded across the plains of Moore Park, 2-1 to the Porkies!
 </p>
 <p>
Stay tuned for next week when the ladies play Coogee United at (surprise) Queens Park 28 at (surprise again) 3pm.
 </p>
Cheers and Porky lurve,<br>

<h4><a name="match-12-12">Maroubra United  2 (1) v (3) 6 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2012 Jun 24]</h4>

Happy Monday Porky People!
<p>
Yesterday Queens Pork played the Bra girls down at Coral Sea and welcomed back our lovely Lyndsay and said farewell (for a while) to rambunctious Ronnie.
</p>
<p>
The sun was shining as Dougal ran us through a warm-up and small-sided game to get ready for the match.  Poor Sonja came to support but was unable to play due to a severe chest infection L After a pump-up speech from Captain of the match Ronnie the gals trotted out for kick off.
</p>
<p>
Whistle!  Maroubra passes the ball to the left, quick cross to a forward who then scores 5 seconds in.  Ruh Roh!
</p>
<p>
Kick-off round two, the ladies in red drop the ball, pass left and Maroubra clears the ball out.  Quick throw in to Emma G who then passes a beeeeautiful diagonal to Tess who is running in to the top box, 1v1 to keeper, and an easy pass into the corner.  Goal to tie the match!!!
</p>
<p>
At 5 minutes in it was shaping up to be a very exciting game.  The play was very bouncy at first, with big clears and out-of-control kicks zooming over the field.  Terrific Tess has to come off due to a nagging hip flexor injury and glorious Gill subs in to right mid-field, meaning we have only 11 for the following 80 minutes!
</p>
<p>
After a rocky start the girls take control of the game and start advancing with well-formed attacks and passes to feet. 
</p>
<p>
On one such attack, Chloe received a cleared ball off of a corner, crosses to Emma C who is at the 6-yard mark, who then volleys it in for an easy-as-pie 2nd goal!  Soon after, QP has a series of corner kicks and dominates in the box.  Aly and Emma C lurk menacingly near the goal and after a deadly corner from Lyndsay, the ball sails over the keeper to bounce around the face of the goal, Emma C has a shot that rebounds of the defense and Aly finishes it off for goal number 3!
</p>
<p>
The game continues on Maroubra’s side, with QP playing truly beautiful soccer.  Honorable mention to Maroubra’s keeper who makes some fantastic saves – but we got one more before the second half when Lyndsay got a rebound at the top of the box and pings it into the goal for a comfortable 4-1 score at the end of the first half!
</p>
<p>
Half-time – Dougal is a happy camper!  We are playing with composure and intensity!  Our loyal men-folk supporters are joined by Lady V and Sophia, and past-porky Karla and company!
</p>
<p>
The second half started similarly to the first – five minutes in Maroubra gets the ball in the box scores.  Oops…
</p>
<p>
Maroubra definitely comes back with a fighting spirit and though QP has the run of the game the next 20 minutes is scoreless.  The back line keeps the ball on the opposition’s side with valiant and consistent defense from Caz, Peta, Alana, and Gill/Ronnie.  Caz and Gill get into the attack, making runs up the line and adding to the offensive plays.  Finally, Emma G gets well-earned possession of the ball on the base-line on the right, and sends a cross to Emma C who heads the ball into the bottom right corner for a million dollar finish.  Goal 5!
</p>
<p>
The play continues on the Maroubra side and after a series of attacks Lyndsay receives another rebound at the top of the box, sending an epic Lyndsay-special into the back of the net, to make the final score of 6-2.  Kachow!
</p>
<p>
The grounds of Coral Sea resounded with the Mighty Might Queens Park victory song!
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for our next game against the Old Boys of Waverley on Heffron!
</p>
Cheers and Porky lurve,<br>

<h4><a name="match-11-12">Queens Park Lions 4 (3) v (1) 1 Sydney Uni</a> [ 2012 Jun 16]</h4>
Hello Porky People!
<p>
Finally, after several rainy weeks and a stormy Saturday, we were graced with a sunny Sunday for the start of Round 3 against Sydney Uni.
</p>
<p>
With Chloe and Alex racing to get to the game after a trip up the coast, and Lindsay and Jen away from Sydney, the squad started out at 11 players - most of whom hadn't played in over two weeks due to the rainy weather!!  Starting in goal was Dirty Deans; Gill, Alana, Peta, and Caz in the back; Tess, Ronnie, Emma G, and Aly at mid; and Sonja (fighting a cold!) and Emma C up top in offense.
 </p>
 <p>
The start of the game was definitely.... rusty, but the gals got it together after Tess, in a burst of energy, intercepted a weak goal kick, surged past the defense, and planted a goal on the bottom right corner.  GOooaalalall!
 </p>
 <p>
Sydney Uni wasn't giving up, and gave our defenders a definite run for their money.  Deans came through with a fantastic save when the opposition had a breakaway at the top of the box.  Deans dove at the SU players' feet and stopped the attack in it's tracks.
 </p>
 <p>
Before the end of the second half we pinged in two more goals - Emma G and Emma C both with well-placed shots from inside the box!
 </p>
 <p>
At half-time we welcomed Chloe and Alex and Dougal have us a bit of a pep talk and so with renewed energy and a squad of 13 we trotted on the the field to finish the game.
 </p>
 <p>
SU game back with intensity and gave QP very little time on the ball.  The game was even, with the play lingering uncomfortabley on the QP side, however SU was unable to make any threatening shots. 
 </p>
 <p>
A counter attack resulted in a great cross to the centre that filtered out to Emma G who was positioned at the top of the box and pinged in a deadly shot that ricocetted off of a defender, over the keepers' hands, and into the goal! 4-0.
 </p>
 <p>
The game continued evenly until the last five minutes when unfortunately an SU midfielder was able to make a killer of a shot from almost half field that sailed over Deans and into the back of the net.  Oh no!
 </p>
 <p>
At the end of the game the Porkies trotted off the field with a 4-1 win, and we are happy to back in action after such a long break!  Next week we welcome Lyndsay back but say a farewell to Ronnie for a while after a third round against Maroubra United!
 </p>
Cheers and Porky lurve,<br/>

		Well,
 <p>
Long time no speak fellow Porkies, Porky lovers, and Porklets.
 </p>
 <p>
You may have noticed a lack of wrap for the last two weeks, and that's because we have had very soggy weather here in Sydney.
</p>
<p> 
2 June 2012- QP vs Coogee
<br>Rained out!
 </p>
 <p>
9 June 2012 - QP vs Dunbar<br>
With only 8 ladies available, and only about 5 feeling 100%, Dougal asked a few of the lower division ladies to join and we very happily welcomed 5 of them who volunteerd, making our squad 13 strong.  Huge thanks to the five QP3s who joined, despite having just played a game against each other directly before our game in the pouring rain!!!
 </p>
 <p>
At kick off it was evident that Dunbar wasn't going to be able to take advantage of our depleted team, as we had the run of the game and even came within a few inches of scoring!!  Playing in several puddles of water on the very cold, rainy afternoon, we worked the ball around the opposition, forming several great attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
At 20 min in, the referee blew the whistle and asked both coaches to join him at the centre circle, where he declared the fields unsafe for play and called the game.  Dunbar threw a fit and the Porkies trotted off to the pub!
 </p>
 <p>
ALSO, special announcement!  We have lost yet another Porky.  Lady V has been messing around with the coach again and as a result we are all very excited to welcome another Guppy into the world for next season!!!!! 
 </p>
 <p>
See you all next week when we play Sydney Uni for round three.  Everyone pray for sunny weather and healthy Porkies!
 </p>
Cheers,<br>

		<h4><a name="match-08-12">Queens Park Lions 1 (1) v (1) 2 Waverley Old Boys</a> [ 2012 May 27]</h4>
		Happy Tuesday Porky People!
<p>
The ladies played Waverley Old Boys for the second time this Sunday and though the sun was shining and the skies were blue, we didn’t quite have the result we were hoping for….
</p>
<p>
3pm – Kick-off with only 11 players in attendance.  Yikes!  We started with Dirty Deans in goal, Alana, Caz, Peta, and Ronnie in defense.  Tess and Sonja were in da middle with Emma C and Aly at left and right mid.  Up top sat Jen and new Porky Jill!  Wheew. 
</p>
<p>
The gals utilized our good foot skills and avoided gusty winds by working the ball up the field with shorter passes and firing several initial shots on goal.  One lucky foul in front of the box gave Sonja a free kick which she pinged to the top post and straight into the back of the net.  Yipeeee!
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately Waverley equalized before the end of the half with an organized attack up the centre, and a shot on Deans from close range.  Doh, 1-1 now.
</p>
<p>
Alana comes off with a painful quad strain and we are down to three in the back!  Waverley utilizes the free man in the second half with a cross from our back line to an awaiting forward, who then places it in the left corner.  Noooooo 1-2 to the Oldies!
</p>
<p>
Soon after QP launches a series of attacks on the Old Boys and we came sooo close a few times, but no luck.  Jen unfortunately gets taken out at the ankle and comes off, leaving 9 Porkies to battle for another goal, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
It was a great game played by all and we had several fantastic attempts on Waverley’s goal but it just wasn’t a Porky day.
</p>
<p>
Not to worry, we are lulling the other teams into a false sense of security.  So sneaky.
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for next week when we battle Coogee and their unruly fans at last year’s stomping ground Heffron at 1pm.
</p>
Cheers and Oinks,<br>

		<h4><a name="match-07-12">Queens Park Lions 3 (0) v (0) 0 Maroubra</a> [ 2012 May 20]</h4>
		Happy Monday Porkettes,
 <p>
This weekend was freezing (relatively) and drizzly in Sydney as the ladies trotted out to our home field, QP28 to play the Bra Girls for the second time this season.
 </p>
 <p>
We were missing our lady leprechauns, Emma C, Lyndsay, and Emma G, but were happy to welcome returned Porky Alana, as well as new Porky Jen for her second game!  So it was with a very lean squad of 12 that we lined up to conquer the gals in green and yellow.
 </p>
 <p>
The first half was a little touch and go, with the new and old players learning to work together in the cold rain.  Maroubra came out with intensity, getting to the 50/50 balls first and firing a few scary shots on dirty Deans! 
 </p>
 <p>
QP quickly turned it around and we began to connect passes and play beeaauuutiful soccer!  Dougal moved Sonja from defense to up front along with Alex and Jen, and Chloe and Tess rocked our socks in centre.  With Ronnie and Aly at wing and helping to transition the ball forward, and the forwards/centres making some awesome short passes, it wasn't long till Ronnie took and ferocious shot on goal that ricochetted off of Maroubra keeper, right into Sonja who made a cool pass into the corner.  Goal 1!!!!!!
 </p>
 <p>
The Bra girls weren't giving up yet, they continued to fire through balls and fast attacks at dependable defenders Caz, Lady V, Peta, and Alana, who blocked every attempt and even started some deadly attacks from the back.  Maroubra was still able to get a few corners on us which were pretty scary - thankfully Deans was on point with some powerful punches to the high balls!
 </p>
 <p>
One attack from the back went up to Sonja (who was now playing in the middle) who faked out the mid-fielders and made a cheeky pass to the corner for Aly to run on to, shoot to the back corner... hit off of a defenders foot... and into the goal.  Goal 2!
 </p>
 <p>
Maroubra was really suffering now, and Queens Park had really found our mojo.  We moved the ball up in attack after attack, finding feet and utilising all areas of the field.  On a quick transition Chloe recieved the ball from the centre and dribbled into the right corner, where she crossed to Jen who was running in and shot... another deflection off of Maroubra D into the GOAL!
 </p>
 <p>
And so we grab another win, at 3-0 to Maroubra! 
 </p>
 <p>
See you next week when we welcome the Irish ladies back and play Waverley Old Boys, again at home :)
 </p>

        <h4><a name="match-06-12">Queens Park Lions 6 (3) v (0) 0 Sydney Uni</a> [ 2012 May 13]</h4>

        Hello Porkys of the World!
        <p>
Yesteday was a chilly but sunny day at Queens Park 28 when the ladies in red rocked up to play Sydney Uni for the second time.
 </p>
 <p>
It was a fantastic turn-out, with new Porky Jen making her debut and several past-Porkies, injured Porkies, Porky Partners, and Porklet offspring there for support! 
 </p>
 <p>
The game started of with a bang, QP immediately putting the pressure on SU and continually working the ball up the field.  Our hard work pays off when superstar Lyndsay sinks the ball, cool as a cucumber into the opposition's net.
 </p>
 <p>
 A mere 15 minutes later a cross from the right (Tess or Jen?) saw a scuffle in the box, a quick clear intercepted by Emma G who knocks the ball from the top of the box, through the fray and into the bottom left corner. 
 </p>
 <p>
Late in the half Emma G gets a nasty studs-up tackle from an SU defender and Aly takes the direct free kick.  A simple chip into the wind and the ball soooars into the goal making the score 3-0!
 </p>
 <p>
Half-time!  Dougal says lets use the width of the field better and attack from the back!  The mighty Deans has a nagging injury and the collective makes the decision to rest Deans so that our favorite keeper comes back strong for next week.
 </p>
 <p>
Starting line-up in second half sees Amazing Alex volunteer for keeper, Vicky, Peta, Sonja, and Ronnie in the back, Tess on the right mid, Aly on the left mid, Emma G and Lyndsay in the middle, and Emma C and Jen up top.
 </p>
 <p>
Early in the first half Lyndsay gets the ball on a tiny clear from SU's keeper and settles, shoots over the keeper who has come out too far and it sinks into the net.  Cheeky goal for Lyndsay!
 </p>
 <p>
Alex and Aly switch places and thank goodness the Porkies have total control over the game so the ball only makes it into Aly's hands twice. On one such occasion Aly lines up to do a FANTASTIC VOLLEY out to half field and.... kicks the ground and drops the ball and freaks out but quickly gains composure to kick the ball into mid-field. Oops, sorry guys!
 </p>
 <p>
Sydney Uni has turned up the pressure but it's just not enough, and for the most part we play on the opposition's side of the field. The back line does a great job of turning SU attacks in QP counter attacks but QP just can't find the net!  Finally, the ball pops into the box, bounces around, and a Porky follows it in for goal # 5... big apologies as I was in goals and couldn't tell who it was... Emma C maybe???  Another, final goal sails into the net just 5 minutes before the final whistle, and I also couldn't tell who scored that one.  I will update later!
 </p>
 <p>
So, a fantastic result to start of the second wave of games, with a 6-0 win over Sydney Uni.  Go the porkies!
 </p>
 <p>
Stay tuned for next week when QP comes against Maroubra United, without any Irish representation as Emma G, Emma C, and Lyndsay are away! 
 </p>
Cheers,<br>
Aly

Hello Porkies near and far!
<p>
Massive apologies for the lack of wraps!  Promise to keep you updated more regularly for the rest of the season.
Here in Sydney, the Porkies have gone through 'round 1' of the season, having played the 5 other teams in Division 1.
In the first wrap we learned that the ladies took two early wins against Sydney Uni and Maroubra, yaaay!
Since then Sydney has gotten colder but the competition is heating up! 
</p>
<p>
Round 3
Game 3 saw the ladies in red at home field Queens Park 28 where we drew against one of last-years biggest foes, Waverley Old Boys.  We were excited to welcome new Porkie Ronnie to our team, another UK superstar! With Dougal stepping in for a late ref at the start of the game, the ladies lost an early goal when a sneaky forward got behind the defence and made a quick run and shot on Dirty Deans.  We kept our heads up and got even when Lyndsay got the ball up top scoooooored!  Deans blocked several crucial sitters and we managed to hold on to the draw until the final whistle blew!
</p>
<p>
Round 4
Again at our tiny yet beloved home field, QP met Coogee United, a team that has returned to the East after many years of competing in the Western Suburbs comp.  It was a very rough game and we lost centre Chloe to an ankle sprain!  The Porkies delivered to Coogee two welcome home goals and gave them none back, grabbing our third win of the season.  Snaps to goal scorers Emma G for an epic long shot and Emma C for her signature $30,000 goal off of a corner! 
</p>
<p>
Round 5
This past Sunday the QP ladies met at Dunbar's new home field in Redfern, the fantastic and very professional NCIE grounds.  We played with only a squad of 11 due to losing our darlings Caroline and Emelie, Chloe still out with an ankile injury, Caz off wining medals at regatta, and Tess flexing her Academic muscles at an overseas conference.  
Dunbar started the game with a bang with an early goal, which was soon returned by a spectacular juggle, turn, and pass into the goal by Alex!  The rest of the game was a battle, with both sides putting on the pressure but Dunbar edged us out with a cross and shot early in the second half.  Emma C, Lindsay, Emma G, Alex, Ronnie, and Aly worked well up front to put pressure on Dunbars defence, but just couldn't finish!  Sonja, Peta, Lady V, Amy, and Deans worked their bums off in defence and put their bodies on the line to deflect Dunbar attacks.  In the end Dunbar got another run past the defence due to a faulty pass from midfield and landed a third goal.  The Porkies kept their heads up and battled till then end, but unfortunately received our first loss at 1-3 to Dunbar.
Next week the QP Lions will come up against Sydney Uni for the second time, this time on our home field, so get ready for another exciting result!  Also special welcome to new Porkie Jen, an exciting new addition to the line up starting Sunday!
</p>
Cheers and Porguette lurve,<br>

        Happy Tuesday morning Porkies near and far!
<p>
This year the AAW1 Porkies are back in action against a new line-up of teams including Sydney University and the ex-premier Coogee Clams, and excluding recently folded teams Glebe, Pagewood, and UNSW.  This means the competition will be even tougher and the games even more action-packed!
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, April Fools 2012, the Queens Park veterans and new members trotted on to Wentworth Park to play on the bumpiest field in the universe.  We were sad to hear that new player Emily won’t be staying in Sydney but wish all the best for her – once a porky always a porky!
</p>
<p>
FIRST HALF:
</p>
<p>
The ladies started out with a bang when, ten minutes into the second half Aly crossed the ball from the right corner to forward Lindsay, who knocked it in to the net.  Gooooal one for the season!
</p>
 
<p>
Sydney Uni didn’t take that sitting down, and attacked the ladies in red with very skillful plays and great fitness.  Fortunately, we had fantastic support in the middle from Tess and Chloe, Aly and Alex on the outside. 
</p>
<p>
A series of slotted balls toward Dirty Deans were expertly circumvented by our speedy back line, this year manned by Amy, Vicky, Caz, Peta, Sonia, Caroline, and all-rounder Emma G who also rocked it in forward.    
</p>
<p>
About 25 minutes in, an attack through the centre sent a ball ricocheting at the top of the opposition’s box, and Emma C, cool as a cucumber, beats the defense and places the ball in the lower right corner just under the keeper’s grasp.  Goooal two!!
</p>
<p>
SECOND HALF:
</p>
<p>
After a positive, then negative, then positive pump-up speech from Dougal and Sophia we rambled onto the pitted field.  Dougal followed as he had to ref the second half due to a no-show lineup of referees! 
</p>
 
<p>
Once again the intensity was up as the Porkies launched a series of attacks at the opposition and they responded in turn.  The field was dusty and bumpy, the players were hot and tired, but we help them off until the final whistle, and a 2-0 result for Queens Park!
</p>
<p>
It was a great start to a promising season, with the team playing as a united front and earning a positive result. 
</p>
<p>
Enjoy the Easter holiday and stay tuned for the next game, April 15, when the ladies play Maroubra United at Coral Sea!
</p>
Cheers and Piggy Love x
