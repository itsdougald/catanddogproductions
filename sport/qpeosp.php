     Queens Park 2 football girls hit Sydney town for their budgeted end of season party! 
     Starting off at the Lord Roberts Hotel in Darlinghurst, stumbling onto Reigos, heading straight 
     to the Coogee Bay Hotel and finally finishing off at Holly's brothers house till the early hours
     of the morning.

     Interestingly Andrew the QP 2 coach for the last three seasons has stood down from his role. With 
     a grand farewell speach Andrew introduced the new manager - me, the Dog! With the intial stun of
     being handed the new role the Dog has taken it in his stride!
