<p>

Well hullo and long time no wrap! 
</p>
<p>
Its been a bit of a hellish July, with limited players, unlimited holidays and injuries, and plenty of bumps along the way.  Entering into August the Porkies are sitting high in the table with only one loss under our belts.
</p>
<p>
July began with several exciting player/coach returns and a game against Waverley Elderly Boys that was, um, EPIC.  With 10 players on the QP side we managed to hand Waverly an embarrassing 2-0 loss in front of a crowd full of Waverley supporters and subs.
</p>
<p>
This past Sunday saw the Porkies reunited in entirety for our final league game against the winner of the Minor Premiership, Dunbar Rovers.  The nervous and excited ladies in red met at normal haunting ground Heffron 55 on the rainy Sunday to face our recent number 1 foes and complainers extraordinaire.
</p>
<p>
Kick-off- tweet!  Dougal has us bunkered in the middle with three centre mids and two attacking wings supported by our four back line (April, Caz, Vicki, and Nic to-geva again!) and one up top.   Dunbar is overwhelmed, we are running the midfield and they aren't getting their normal attacks by!  The wings are left with a lot of space to run with.  April crosses an excellent ball from half-line to Aly who is wide open at the top of the box!  Keeper comes out and defender runs to cover but Aly slots a curved ball into the net and the keeper ends up squished underneath the defender.  GOAL!
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later: several more attacks and shots by Lorraine, Chloe, Lyndsay, Tess, Tahlia, and Aly.  Chloe slots a ball through the defensive line while Tess makes a diagonal run to the top of the box.  Tess passes the ball into the goal and ends up on top of the aggressive keeper.  Sucks for her, too much girl on girl action means another GOAL....followed closely by a third!!  Aly can't really remember- was this one a pass up the centre to Lorraine who bangs it in?  Someone correct me if I'm wrong. 3-0 to the Porkies!  A Dunbar forward screams 'we may as well walk of the field now if we are going to play like this!'  Bliss.
</p>
<p>
Later in the half, a forward gets a cheeky run in and is expertly (CLEANLY) tackled by Crazy Caz.  Ref calls it as a PK- boo- and a perfect shot in the corner past Deans' impressive dive means the score now stands a 3-1.  Argh!  Sandy Pants, Bex, Gargs, and Sonja sub in and the attack continues for the rest of the half until a quick attack from earlier Dunbar PK kicker slots into the goal, much to our dismay!  3-2 Shiz!
</p>
<p>
Half-time.  Woooo get a breather and a pump up from Dougal.  We can do it!
</p>
<p>
Kick-off.  Aly is playing with Sophia so misses it- but 5, 6, 7 passes, Dunbar doesn't even touch it and GOAL!!  4-2 Um, good pump-up speech Dougal!  However, Dunbar has gotten their act together and comes back fighting.  Thank goodness for Deans the Dinosaur, who saves an great shot to the upper crossbar with a punch and catch!  And in a scuffle in front of the box, shot blocked by Caz to ricochet into attacking forward who shoots from the 6 yard line- and into Deans' lightning-quick grasp!  EXCELLENT work from Vicki and Caz, with several defensive headers out of the air, and Sandra, April, and Nic, who cut down wing runs and turned scary moments into attacks by re-distributing to the midfield. 
</p>
<p>
Half continues with Lyndsay, Chloe, Sonia, and Tess running their bums off and playing defense and attack with precision.  Bex, Gargs, Tahlia, and Lorraine continue putting the pressure on Dunbar non-stop!
</p>
<p>
At one point Vicki clears a breakaway ball to the side and it bounces off Aprils shoulder and out of bounds.  Ref calls a PK-WHAAT?- and we are sweating bullets.  Earlier PK scorer from Dunbar lines up to kick- and SAVED by the mighty Deans.  WHAT NOW FOOLS.
</p>
<p>
Tick tock to the end of the game, Tahlia gets the ball from a cross from the wing (Lyndsay or Bex maybe? I am too busy snuggling Sophia again) and takes it to the base line to expertly cross past the keepers grasp and into the back post for Lorraine to put in the net.  GOAL 5-2.  This is AMAZING. 
</p>
<p>
Clock winds down and Porkuettes sing their victory song around a curious but polite Sophia.  Credit to Dunbar, they kept on fighting and thanked us for a good game.  Honorable mention to Kerri who has come to every game to support her fellows since hurting her Achilles, and making sure to banter with the sideline ref at the same time.  Wohoo!
</p>
<p>
Then Drinks. 
</p>
<p>
Next up is DUNBAR again, going into the finals- we are seated as 1, Dunbar as 2, Waves as 3, and Glebe at 4.  See ya then!
</p>

<h4><a name="match-07-11">Queens Park Lions 4 (3) v (1) 2 Marickville</a> [ 2011 May 22]</h4>
<p>
At long last the Porkies found themselves back at their home fields in Queens Park.  But wait, QP28 is actually Marrickville’s home field now?!  We shall make them pay!
</p>
<p>
Young Marrickville fell to QP at our first game of the season, and we were determined repeat the favor.  Right from the start it was evident that Queen’s Park was collectively the stronger, better team.  Marrickville’s inability to connect with each other and unhurried approach to the ball means they lack presence on the field, but the team has some individual gems- their keeper in particular!
</p>
<p>
For most of the first half the porkies camped in front of the opposition’s goal, which gave the Marrickville goalie plenty of opportunities to show off her skill and massive punts.  Still, it was no surprise when Lorraine planted the ball firmly in the back of the net with one of her famous volleys!  Shortly after that Tahlia got a beautiful cross for Gargs and expertly slotted a shot into the far left corner.  2-1 to the Porkies!
</p>
<p>
Soon after, Marrickville started to threaten our side of the field a bit.  Despite the mighty Dean’s awesome goalkeeping and improving aggressiveness, Marrickville slipped a scrappy one into the back of our net on a corner kick.  Boo!
</p>
<p>
Not to be outdone, the QP offense battled with a renewed fervor and peppered Mville’s goal with shot after shot.  Finally, after a skirmish at the top of the box, Lorraine capitalized with a hard shot to the far corner, which slammed off the post and into the….GOOOALLL!
</p>
<p>
Half time saw a big pump-up talk from Dougal, as to be honest everyone seemed a bit flat.  Except Sophia, who made the epic crawling journey from Mummy V to Daddy!
</p>
<p>
Second half was much the same as the first, except perhaps Marrickville got a little more pep and the ref got a bit excited about using his whistle on the ladies in red.  Queens Park was not to be outdone and battled in the middle of the field, gaining several attacks from the right side.  Marrickville slipped a handful of attacks behind the defense but Deans, Vicki, April, and Caz managed to stop every onslaught.  At one point Deans even blocked a shot with her face.  What a trooper!  Finally, a run up the right hand side and a high shot took us all by surprise and soared into our net.  3-2, oh noes they are gaining on us!
</p>
<p>
Queens Park responded with several runs up the sides, distributed from the defense and pinged around by the middies and forwards.  One such attack went to Lyndsay in the center, who made a beautiful diagonal pass into the box for Aly to run on to, fake out a defender and slip the ball into the near post.  Yay the porkies, 4-2!
</p>
And so the Porquettes tuck another two wins into their very tight waistbands.  Stay tuned for more action!

Hello porquettes worldwide!
<p>
Vast apologies for the gaps in wraps, it is no doubt due to the fact that the Porkies are extremely busy, successful, and important.  As a result this email offers a double feature!
</p>
<p>
Sunday May 15, QPFC vs. Glebe
</p>
<p>
The porkies arrived to Heffron on a leisurely, sunny morning and began an easy warm-up which included pelting balls at Dougal’s head as he sat on the field.  After a good stretch and some inspiring words from Couch, the porkettes jogged onto the field to face the Wanderers, our long-time respected foes.  Glebe was missing some of their key players and did not put up the quality fight we are used to receiving from them.  This, combined with the fact that QP was having an epic game of total soccer, meant one thing:  The Glebe Wanderers had no chance!  With excellent support from our defensive line, including new and beloved Lyndsay, the offenders were free to launch attack after attack on the humorous Glebe goalkeeper.
</p>
<p>
And then everything changed in an instant!  After a scramble in the midfield, Glebe’s forwards won the ball and bounced it around the top of the box.  Their center forward knocked the ball into the top corner of our goal, just over Dean’s fingertips….. and miraculously she tipped the shot over the crossbar!  Denied, go Anita!
</p>
<p>
The Porkies responded to the near-goal with renewed energy and quickly got a series of goals by Tahlia, Kerry, and Chloe (and another that I can’t remember- Sonja, Bex or Lyndsay maybe?- sorry!).  In the end, the Porkies earned a convincing win of 5-0 over Glebe and the voices of our triumphant song rang out over Heffron fields.
</p>

<h4><a name="match-03-11">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (0) 3 Dunbar</a> [ 2011 Apr 31]</h4>
Hi all,
<p>
A thousand apologies for this very late wrap!  I've lost my Queen's Park list for all Porkies near and far, so please forward this on to our international supporters and veterans AND send me their email address to add on for future wraps.
</p>
<p>
Well the game against Dunbar began on a busy Sunday afternoon at Heffron 55, a muddy and crater-filled pitch we are all to familiar with.  However, the sun was shining for the first time in days and the Porkies were ready for a good fight!
</p>
<p>
The play was fast-paced and intense from the very start, excepting a definite lag from our young referees.  Dunbar is a feirce oponant with very strong international players in its arsenal.  Queens Park was immediately overwhelmed by the heavy pressure but Keeper Deans and her defense kept the ball out of our net whilst the middies and attack stuggled to transition to the other side of the feild.  In the last 20 minutes of the second half the Porky spark surfaced and we had a stellar few runs on the opposition, unfortunately to no avail.
</p>
<p>
The second half was similar to the first, with the Porkies meeting the Dunbar Rovers' every challenge, but not quite getting the edge we needed to put one in the net.  Around the 70 minute mark our biggest fears came to life when a Dunbar Swede slammed the ball into our net.  The floodgates opened when two more goals to the opposition followed.
</p>
<p>
Despite adversity the Porkies played well to the finish and kept our heads up.  We cheered eachother on, congratulated Dunbar for the win, and vowed that they won't get away with it next time!
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned for this past Sunday's match against the NOT so mighty Maroubra!
</p>
Cheers,<br>
Aly

<h4><a name="match-02-11">Queens Park Lions 7 (3) v (0) 1 UNSW</a> [ 2011 Apr 10]</h4>
<p>
  Although the sun went away on match day, the conditions were perfect for Porky play.
</p>
<p>
The game against UNSW commenced with Queens Park taking control from the start and with the rain and wind blowing a gale from behind us during the first half, our forwards and midfielders played well together to not only create some great opportunities but to also keep the majority of play at the opposition’s end of the field.
</p>
<p>After settling into the muddy match, it was not long before Twinkle-Toes Tess finally found her patch and booted the ball into the net. The first goal gave us a zap of energy and before we all knew it, Lightening-Foot Lorraine had cracked a couple more shots into the goal.
</p>
<p>Realising that this game was quickly slipping out of the grips of UNSW’s boots, they eventually made a break towards QP’s goal line. A lucky break it was as the ball came loose from goalie’s gloves and their player popped in UNSW’s first and only goal of the match.  Lightening-Foot Lorraine quickly retaliated and lobbed in another great goal before the Porkies trotted off to the sheds to drip dry at half time.
</p>
<p>The second half was always going to be much more of a challenge with the gale now blowing against our trotters. UNSW managed to make more runs towards QP’s goal line however our defence stuck together and successfully shut them out.
</p>
<p>The Porklets performed further great manoeuvres in the quagmire and it was not long until the Awe-inspiring Ally punted in another astonishing goal.
</p>
<p>UNSW struggled to hold us back and were pretty much broken when King-Kicker Kerry finally took some of the glory and cracked in one of her own goals. Lightening-Foot Lorraine took her final goal from UNSW before taking it easy on the exhausted team.
</p>
<p>Even though it felt like we were kicking around a cannonball and that the temperature had dropped considerably as our saturation increased, QP put in a triumphant effort playing strong until the end.  The finished with Queens Park the conquerors at 7-1 and our first Porky chant.
</p>

<h4><a name="match-01-11">Queens Park Lions 5 (3) v (0) 2 Marickville</a> [ 2010 Apr 3]</h4>
<p>
Hi guys and gals, sorry for the late wrap!  Been a crazy week....
</p>
<p>
Queens Park vs. Marrickville, April 3 2011
</p>
<p>
G’day porkies near and far!
</p>
<p>
Our first game of the season was held at Queens Park on a sunny day with blue skies.  In true porky fashion the field set-up and game warm-up was a bit, erm, confused- but Dougal and the ladies in red got focused and on the field in time for the whistle!  Our opponents are new to the league, as their various 16 year olds disqualify Marrickville from competing closer to home.  So it was with determination that the Experienced Porklets ran out to compete with the young guns.
</p>
<p>
Kick-off saw both teams playing with skill and intensity.  Right off the bat Queens Park threatened their opponents with several shots on goal.  The team looked great- Deans rocking her fluero in goal and defenders Nic, Dani, Caz, Vicki, and April holding their line and shutting down all attacks.  Tess and Caroline debuted as center mids and were first to every ball, playing together brilliantly and feeding to the forwards, creating opportunities right and left!  Bex, Sandra and Aly rocked the wings with several attacking runs up the side.  Finally, Keri and Lorraine proved to be deadly in the front, serving challenge after challenge to the Marrickville defense.
</p>
<p>
The first goal, courtesy of Keri, was a composed shot from the top of the box despite pressure from three defenders.  Shortly after, Keri got fouled in the box after receiving a brilliant pass from Tess in the center, and Keri let Aly take the PK.  Goal two!  Lorraine and Bex had several attacks up the right side that paid off when Lorraine sunk a powerful shot in the back of the net.  And so the Porkies jogged to the sidelines at half time with a lead of 3-0!
</p>
<p>
After some coachly advice from Dougal, Sophia, and Max (starting with the positives, of course) Queens Park ran back onto the field to finish what we started.  The second half started similarly to the first, with renewed energy from the younger Marrickville.  The Porkies suffered a slight blow to our morale when Keri took a hard hit from the keeper to her leg and head, and then Caroline went down in a tackle- and stayed down.  The always-capable Alex Gargett ran onto the field to help as a calming and knowledgeable professional and the team worked together to carry our lovely Caroline off the field.
</p>
<p>
After this the Porkies gave two goals to the opponents when they made their most powerful attacks of the day.  Not to be put down, the porkies renewed their efforts and soon a cracking corner from Lorraine hit a Marrickville defender on the back post- as she was standing inside the net.  That’s 4-2 to QPFC!            Finally, the humble, modest, newly flamboyant, and extremely good-looking Aly carried the ball up the left side, faked out a defender, and scored!  5-2 Porkies, that’s a wrap!
</p>
<p>
And so the Porkies start the season with a win under our belts/elastic waistbands.  Watch this space for next week’s match against UNSW, and a match report from new wrapper, keeper Anita Deans!
</p>

Cheers,
<br>

<h4><a name="match-00-11">(Friendly)Kogorah Waratahs v Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2010 Mar 26]</h4>
It’s that time again!  Football season is upon us, which means Porky match reports will once again be weekly delivered to Porky inboxes around the world. 

<p> 
Today was the first and last friendly of the season hosted by the Kogerah Warratahs.  The ladies gathered in carpool bunches before the game and all were happy to see Captain Nic back in action, albeit a bit jetlagged.  Dougal conducted our pre-game warm-up whilst Sophia monitored with her game face.  The Porkettes ended the warm-up with a small-sided game and were dismayed to find that our new Coogee Bay Palace sponsored bibs are…the same color as our jerseys!  So red jerseys played red bibs without jerseys- bow chicka wow wow! 
</p>
<p>
Kick-off went to the Warratahs and the younger team immediately put on the pressure through a series of attacks and set pieces.  Queens Park’s stoic defense and flashy new keeper Deans kept KW at bay and the midfield and attack struggled to make the frame.  After several shots on both sides, the opposition connected on a deadly cross and a mid-air kick to the back corner.  Another goal quickly followed but the Porkies kept fighting!  Midfielder Tessa injured her left gludius maximus (bum) in the middle of a fierce skirmish but pushed through the pain and kept on fighting.
</p>
<p>
At half time the score stood at 0-2 but QP didn’t let it dampen our spirits.  However, the onslaught of rain dampened the Porkies as we fought our way through the second half.   Both teams gave their best effort and Keri and Bex had some close shots after s series of beautiful baseline crosses and great passing within the center field.  In the end, the KW’s slipped a shot into the corner of our goal and the final whistle blew at 0-3.  QP cheered for our opponents and jogged off the field to hear Dougal’s post game speech.  The great news is Queens Park is stronger than ever at the start of a season and our passing is solid.  Today we got the early season jitters out and will now proceed to the business end of the season, as Danni and Dougal say.  Which means everyone better watch out for the Mighty Mighty Queens Porkies!
