        <p><strong>End of Season Summary Report, written by Coach Dougal [26th Sep]</strong></p>
        <p>What a contrast, what a year, what a result! League and Grand final champions 2008 - writing this now brings a huge smile to my face. We seriously deserved both titles this year. With a new look to the team, our spirits grew to
        enormous levels of strength and playing as a football team should.</p>
        <p>Taking on a big squad was initially a good idea, as <a href="?#season-2007">last season</a> we struggled to get a full team out on occassions but this year was different. We took on 20 (21 initially) strong, keen players and very few
        wanted to miss a game! This did cause problems at the beginning and words were said, but all I could do was stick to a system I knew that would work and was fair to the core. We did lose one player early on and there were fireworks, but this was their decision to go. Again with a few
        disgruntled players, our season got off to a great start, topping the league after two games.
        </p>
        <p>
        With intense long training sessions and a Dougal drone feature, felt the girls game all took a dip but all for the better, we came back even stronger and with supreme confidence. Took me time to find out players best positions but lukcily our keeper spot was taken by Sam, a phenominal
        keeper who improved tenfold over the season and our most versatile player, Anita. A true athlete who filled in for Sam's absence.
        </p>
        <p>
        Mid-season we were mid-table and struggling to put any victories together. We had many draws, a few of which were down to poor referring decisions, or in fact due to not having an official referee, but the turning point was our game against <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-10-08" target="new">Lokomotiv Cove</a>.
        The same problem we had last season was the urgency to play from the whistle. We were dazed. Confused and slow to react to a game and it was costing us. So we all discussed and agreed we needed something to pep us up!....Nic Belton had talked about a song she sang with
        Hackney Marshes (UK) and said we could change the team name to ours and it was all ours....perfect. So we all decided this was to be sung before and after every game from now on.....from then on we never lost a game - 12 to be precise. Amazing. The song lifted our spirits and we all felt invincible.
        </p>
        <p>
        With the new song, we had lots of work to do to confirm our top 4 spot. We were 12 points off Glebe and Lokomotiv Cove had a game in hand and on even points with us. Coogee had drawn in a first team keeper and Waverley mysteriously had a first team keeper playing out on field - the whole league was very tight. Another turning point in the season was
        our <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-13-08" target="new">4 nil</a> win over Glebe. They turned up expecting to win. Manager had a case of beers and was celebrating vicotry before they'd begun. How wrong they were. We had to win and that we did. 4-0! We  drove them into the ground and could not believe it.
        They had their star player, "Amanda" (every team seem to have a player called Amanada!) and their defender (No. 5) was ill, but even so we took no prisoners. 
        </p>
        <p>We now had our sights on second spot and perhaps even a chance to take top spot as we later realised the last league game would be against Glebe. This could be a fairytale ending!</p>
        <p>
        We did have two draws, which were tough, against <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-14-08" target="new">Maroubra</a> and <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-15-08" target="new">Lokomotiv</a> and could have deminished our hopes in getting top spot but Coogee and Waverley with their newly
        appointed players were getting results in our favour. So the 2-2 all draw against Loko was our last draw. In fact we went on to win 7 games on the trot (oink oink!). We had a team's worth of scorers (11), so everyone was playing a part.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-20-08" target="new">17th August</a>, the day had come and as we only thought, with a glimmer of hope, that our last league game was against the league title game, and what a game! The title was in our own hands. It was great we didn't have to rely on any other results. 
        It was down to the two teams on the pitch. Glebe were strong and forgotten how tough Amanda and their No.5 was. Also later found out their No.3 (forward) had scored 17 goals and was a real threat too. But not this day. Our defence were again impeccible. With a few players carrying niggly injuries, battled through. Karla scored a phenominal goal which broke the
        ice and opened the gates in the first half. Funny enough I'd been teaching the girls how to kick over their heads (a Hopkins special) and think it paid off! We had a few lows in the first half and Glebe equalised and had a couple more chances which they should have taken. Vicky had the chance to go up front as Karla went down with a nasty injury from Amanda's takle.
        Vicky took to her forward role like a bee to honey and delivered a cheeky goal to go 2-1 up. The game was tight to the end but with Holly popping in a third the league was in the bag!!! You beauty!!!!....celebrations were much deserved and we all hit Newtown.....hard!!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
        With the league under wraps, we had two, or potentially three games left to take our season to a higher level and winning the Australian coveted Grand Final. I won't go into detail about the semi but it was tough, again. I was more nervous about this game than any other.
        Realising that Glebe only played a long ball game and played Amanda in the wrong position (lucky for us) but Anita poked in a goal, late in the first half, which was the only goal of the day. We had many chances but so did they. Sam was strong in goal and soon beginning to snatch the title of "Panther" from Coogee's first team keeper.
        She especially made a difference in the <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-21-08" target="new">semis</a> but also the finals! 
        </p>
        <p>
        With a quick celebration after the semis at Pagewood Hotel (not the best pub) we'd earnt a well earned rest before the grand final at Hensley Athletic ground on 21st Sept @ 11.30am.
        </p>
        <p>
        <a href="http://www.catanddogproductions.com/sport/qpl_match_reports.php#match-22-08" target="new">GRAND FINAL</a> day. We were all nervous and didn't know what to expect, anything happens in finals, no matter what sport. Sandra's gut feeling was that we would win - her gut feeling had never failed and it didn't this time either, we won 3-1! With a freak goal from No.5 early in the first half, our
        game play did not change for 90 minutes. We played football, Glebe didn't. Perhaps my maths test went on a little too long before the game but it settled our nerves. We kept our composure the whole game. We created some great chances but Glebe's defence were solid. Luckily we equalised with a few minutes before half time, which
        was a huge relief. We deserved to be level, at least. With a good half time talk, felt the girls knew they could take this grand final title in the esecond half. With no defence change from me (consulted with Ky on this), had no choice, grand final day is just different
        to any other game. One tactical change and it could cost us. With our strong, quick play down both sides but also through the middle, Nicola slotted in a well paced goal mid-way into the second half. Thank god!!! We were ahead, fianlly!! 10 minutes later Holly slotted in the thrid to confirm victory. Only then could I make defensive changes. It was tight to the end and again Glebe had a few chances that could have
        got them back but our newly titled Panther was phenominal!
        </p>
        <p>
        The whistle blew and the porkies were Grand final champions 2008. Take that Glebe. We celebrated. Hard. I gave a little speech before our medals and trophey were handed out. It was a magical feeling. In fact as I type now still have that same feeling. Incredible.
        We all headed down to Clovelly Hotel and drank. (ate a little) but mostly drank till we were kindly escorted out and shaparoned back to ours. We partied even harder till 2am. Yes neighbours did complain and in fact was told yesterdy by Ronan he could hear myself and the girls all night (and they live in a block across the road and at the back of the building!) - said we were
        hilarious to listen too (I don't think the rest of the neighbourhood thought that though!!)....
       </p>
       <p>
       So there we have it. A contrast to last year. I wouldn't change a thing. It was a great learning process for everyone and already looking forward to the challenge next season!

        Hey fellow Porkies!
        </p>
        <p>
        It is with great sadness that I write my final Sunday Wrap for the season. I have thoroughly enjoyed playing/socialising/celebrating with you all this year and I hope you have liked reading my wraps and found some humour in them from time to time! 
        </p>
        <p>
        The big GF, a feat they very few get to experience in a lifetime. Yesterday was a cracker of a game, I'm so glad that we got to play Glebe and really show them, again what a quality football side we are! Our skills, team spirit, enthusiasm and sheer determination make us a very competitive team and it is a great feeling to be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
        I could have been physically sick from nerves yesterday morning (I'm sure I wasn't the only one) I must have made 10 trips to the loo before 9am and my hands were shaking like mad. But they were eventually settled by coach Dougal's quick maths test! Team score 100% (I think).
        </p>
        <p>
        The atmosphere at Hensley was fabulous, there was lots of red and black in the grandstand which really made the occasion one to remember. Our supporters yesterday and throughout the season have been amazing and we really lift when there's someone there to watch us, thanks again for everything - we love yous all!!!
        </p>
        <p>
        It was great to finally have a ref and 2 linesmen, better late than never I guess! They were very professional checking shirt numbers and studs, thank God they didn't check hair clips as I was sporting 8! We were also very lucky to have our own team physio... Ky, thanks for your support and assistance on the pitch you're a champ! Thanks also to Karla for her involvement in yesterday's game, we really appreciated your sideline assistance and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
        The game...
        </p>
        <p>
        When Glebe scored in the first 5 minutes I knew we still had it in us to come back and bounce right over the top of them, which is what we did. Our goal scorers for the match were Emma K (1st half just in the nick of time - 30 second left in the half!) and Nicola and Holly (2nd half), but what's so great about the porkies is you would've thought it was any one of us that had scored.
        </p>
        <p>
        When the final whistle blew, the feeling was quite sureal, I think my celebratory cheer was delayed by a few seconds! But we did it, we triumphed over a team that we knew we could beat and became both league and grand final champions (3-1) FINALLY!
        </p>
        <p>
        After collecting our gold medals and lots of hugging, cheering and photos, the celebrations kicked on at the Cloey... I'm still burping the nachos, but boy it was good! Dougal and Sandra were presented with their gifts, soccer ball cufflinks/cash for Dougal and a porky key ring/cash for Sandypants - thanks again guys for everything!
        </p>
        <p>
        And then...
        </p>
        <p>
        We did get asked to leave the Cloey so we decided to take the party to Coogee, to Mr & Mrs Guppy's flat! I hope your neighbours still like you today! Also I've never seen 4 pizzas disappear so quick! Today my body feels like that of an 80 year old, I'm not sure if it's from the game or the wrestling competitions that Emma K and I had on the lounge room floor!!! Liz was in heaven, singstar kept her amused and provided us with great entertainment until the wee hours of the morning. D & V, I think you'll need to take the recycling out a little each day or your neighbours are going to think you two have a serious problem!
        </p>
        <p>
        I arrived home just after 1am and my mum and dad (half asleep) congratulated me on our win, I decided to go and jump on them both and show them my very shiny gold medal!!! They are very proud of their little piglet!
        </p>
        <p>
        So now, it's time to detox for the next 5 days before the big end of season party at Paddo Bowls club. We have the bowling lanes booked from 2-5pm so I'll get there a bit before 2pm, food will be served around 3.30-4pm so if you're not there at that time I'm sorry but it will be served as platters not individual meals. As the day will be starting quite early we need to pace ourselves to some degree, hopefully there are a few suggestions of where to go later on, but the policy of; 'if you don't get in, go home' (harsh I know, but...) might have to stand.
        </p>
        <p>
        I am collecting points from yesterday (thanks Sam you got in first!) give as many as you like, but not 3 to all! The standings for the Player's Player award (aka Porky) is extremely tight and your points could make all the difference. I will be doing the final tally on Thursday, so your points need to be in before then.
        </p>
        <p>
        Hopefully shirts will be ready today, I'm going to call at lunch time. Nic please send me your address in London.
        </p>
        <p>
        Have a fab week everyone! See you on Wednesday (for 6 aside) or Saturday.
        Over and out for 2008 <br />

        Mighty, mighty Queens Park! Yaaaaahoooooooooooooooo... GF here we come!!!!!
        </p>
        <p>
        So we now have the grand final spot firmly in our grasp, but the trophy's not ours just yet! One very important match is left for this season and boy will it be a tense and triumphant game.
        </p>
        <p>
        Today we played 90 minutes of good footy, every player put 110% into their game/our game and that's what allowed us to take the win fair and square (even though we think it should have been 2-0, Holly's goal was called off-side... I'm not so sure about that call!) Well done to our only goal scorer of the match... Anita. A quick, sneaky goal that literally dribbled past the goalie, she just watched it roll over the line.
        </p>
        <p>
        Brilliant defending and attacking saw quality shots, passes and plays. Excellent goal-keeping and shouting from Sam kept both QP and Glebe on their toes.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our supporters as usual were positive and up-lifting, you guys really make a difference to the way we play so thank you for your on-going support... we love all, especially Seth for the most delicious cupcakes ever, thanks heaps Seth!
        </p>
        <p>
        Coach Dougal, we know that you're proud of us, but we are of you too. Thanks for all your hard work and dedication to us as a team, you're a super coach. I hear that training on Tuesday could be a gruelling session but Thursday is going to be a bit more relaxed followed by pizza and 'Bend It Like Beckam' (possibly) at Nic B's house (Nic please confirm!)
        </p>
        <p>
        We are going to keep going with points, so please send them through for today and the last match against Glebe (at St Peters) if you forgot.
        </p>
        <p>
        Shirts are going to be sent off for printing tomorrow and should take 8-10 days, I'll hand them out as soon as I get them back.
        </p>
        <p>
        Have a great week<br>

        <p>
        SW2 LEAGUE CHAMPIONS 2008!!
        </p>
        <p>A gallant effort by all today, a minor premiership or should I say...top of the league with number one status under our belt... gooooooo Porkies!!!! We couldn't have asked for a better start to the morning, sunshine, crisp air and mud, lots and lots of mud in the pen, well suited to a team of porkers!
        </p>
        <p>
        Despite a few injuries our team was by far the most superior on the pitch today. Stitches, a broken toe and strained muscles didn't stop us (thank goodness we have a week for you all to recover though!) as we triumphed over a very rattled and might I say nasty bunch of b**ches! (have to censor for the school emails).
        </p>
        <p>
        3 Brilliant goals were scored by Karla (she finally got the kick and flick goal she has been wanting all season), Vicky (was that a toe poke?) and Holly (our super mum) and not to forget everyone else who assisted in one way or another to help them with their quest! I'm sure you would all agree that the final score should have read 4-0 instead of 3-1, but the 'cheating' ref didn't seem to want to open his eyes a bit wider (I wonder why???).
        </p>
        <p>
        Super support on the sideline, thanks for coming along to see us, looking forward to seeing some of those photos (I think!) and last but certainly not least a HUGE thank you to our dedicated and hard working coach... Dougal! You have turned the SW3 team around this year and we are VERY, VERY grateful. I think you might need a new pair of shoes by the end of finals as they are wearing thin from all the pacing up and down the sideline, how are the fingernails, any left???
        </p>
        <p>
        Tess you are an IT guru, I love the porky power, girl (oops that's Dougal's word) you and I need to chat we have some serious t-shirt investigations to discuss! Do you think you might be able to add in a soccer (or football) into the pic?
        </p>
        <p>
        Please send through your porky points, I'm happy to add as many as you think you need to give this round, so no limit!
        </p>
        <p>
        It looks like the end of season celebration will be on Saturday 27th September, apologies if you are unable to make it, but that was the best date for most people. Don't worry we will have a celebration when we take the big trophy on the 21st! Hey Sandy Pants, we need to make sure we get our medals, I need to take it in and show it off to the kids in my class! Invitation to be sent out towards end of week (when I have finally handed my accreditation documents in).
        </p>
        <p>
        Hope the porkies didn't roll out of the union today, (a great place, thanks Tess) or are you still there???
        </p>
        <p>
        Have a great week, see you Tuesday for training. Good luck getting your stitches out Deans!

        Apart from remaining very, very happy are there any porkies feeling a wee bit sorry for themselves today?
That was a great after party but I fear it was just getting started when I left at 2:30pm.

        Keen to hear what pubs you went to, what other pieces of furniture were destroyed and who is regretting skulling champaign.

        Well......we went inside to play pool for a bit. Dougal beat everyone again (tall) Liz seemingly went home and came back again several times. She also kept buying drinks. Linda bought more drinks. We drank. Karlita and Deans went home :o( So did Linda and (tall) Liz
        </p>
        <p>
        We all went to a pub seemingly two suburbs away. The name escapes me. We then went for a curry. Which was yum but we got some funny looks. Kookaburra and Chewbacka(sp?) were there too....
        </p>
        <p>
        THEN it all went a bit Pete Tong. I 'lost' my phone and lovely lovely Mark drove me around Newtown looking for it. By this time we gave up, we'd lost everyone so Nicola, Mark, Ky and I went for a quiet one at the Harp. And a few more funny looks. Then lovely lovely Mark drove us home. Ky fell asleep on the way and Nicola and I talked dribble.  Did I mention Mark was lovely?
        </p>
        <p>
        Ky found my phone in her pocket immediately on arrival home. Payback for Holly's cardnapping according to her this morning. She feels very small today. Nothing new there for me......
        </p>
        <p>
        Funny night, but I get the feeling I missed a few bits. Anyone care to fill in the gaps?
        </p>
        <p>
        I hurt all over today. Even inside my head.
        <br/>

        </p>
        <p>
        Head hurts, unquenchable thirst, belly like a washing machine but it was oh so worth it cos WE WON THE LEAGUE!!!!!! 
        </p>
        <p>
        I was also so excited all day! My niece and nephew were like “SO you haven’t won the grand final yet”… those little buggers- Ant my nephew played in the state carnival for footy so a minor premiership was a little too easy to win for him…. But he promised if we made the grand final he would come and watch “girls footy” so not only do I now want to win because we kick arse and deserve it! But I need to make sure that little smart arse watches ”girls” play footy (he’s 11 and very unimpressed with anything girls do).
        </p>
        <p>Anyway guys I was so impressed with the game from the sidelines- all the team work- beautiful passing and some very heavy hits taken so well. I was so PROUD!!!!!! And  glad the celebrations were long. I ate heaps of chocolate cake and had a beer with Dad to celebrate!!! Bring on Glebe again.
         </p>
         <p>(Fingers crossed this back loosens up and I will see you all on Tuesday).</p>

        <p>
        
yes kellie<br>
i feel very sorry for myself- head hurts, throat hurts, can't walk properly and to top it off just remembered i've got my dentist appointment in an hour to have a wisdom tooth filling so mouth will be sore (hope dentist doesn't pass out from beer fumes!) but as evertbody has said it doesn't matter because<br />
 WE ARE THE PORKY CHAMPIONS!!!!!!!!<br />
(and just to rub it in i'm not working so can spend most of the day lying on the sofa trying to get back my lost day of sleep)
ps how are the rest of you injured porkies- karla is the bruised bump on your leg now the size of a football?
          </p>
          <p>
          Not feelin too bad today - but it was definitley the curry that saved me....my lips are stiull scarlet red from the hotness of it but how bad - we are the champions! .....vague memories of blowing a whistle down the corridor on my way to the loos in the curry place....did u have a whistle with u Dougal? Tess, super porky looks great for the t-shirts. Ok time for another glass of water..... See ye thurs

          Oh what a day!!!!!!!!!</p>
          <p>
It's all worth it, feeling a little headsore, but not too bad....the most
painful thing is my leg, does anyone know what I should do for a corked
thigh? (I think that's what I have), I'm hobbling around and in doing a
weird crab walk up and down the stairs at school because I can't bend my
leg or put pressure on my thigh without quite a lot of pain shooting up
through my musle.....that number 18!!!! I'll get her next time :)
          </p>
          <p>
We are the champions my friend...and we'll keep on fighting till the end,
WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS, WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS,

          Hiya Porky Champs! :)
          </p>
          <p>
          What a Game and what a great celebration we had Yeeeeepeeeeeeeeee! :^).  I feel very proud to be part of such a great team pals, we worked hard for it with the awesome coaching and guidance of our dearest coach Dougal and well, I'd say we played as champs yesterday to defend our place! It was a great feeling that we were all trusting each other on the field and putting our head and hearts on the game.
          </p>
          <p>
          It seems that fountain climbing takes a lot more energy that what I thought ;), as I went to bed as soon as we got home and kept on sleeping until this morning!!!
          </p>
          <p>
          ...& well, morning morning, I woke up with a big bruised purple lump and my knee was hurting quite a bit -it was a bit of a challenge to get ready for work, the hardest bit was trying to put my socks on as I was in pain trying to bend my leg. I'd say we should not play Glebe without a proper Ref ever again otherwise they will end up getting the rest of our team injured!
          </p>
          <p>
          But hey! No matter how hard and dirty tricks they through on us... We just play better football than them!!!! :) We WON THE LEAGUE Porkies YEEEEEPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
           </p>
           <p>
          Hope you all have a great week Porky Champs! :^)

          </p>
          <p>
          Nothing like hearing lil versions of the day/night through a 'bag' of
          emails at the wee hours of the morn' at least I get to giggle a bit :)
          </p>
          <p>
          Victory is sweet, ready for the big win and the even bigger
          celebrations!!! Tess and 'printing crew', I think we might need those
          porky t-shirts 'pronto' so we can unleash our 'porkers' during the finals
          and have them lurking beneath our red shirts just waiting....
          </p>
          So is Tueday training officially off??

        <h4><a name="match-17-08">Queens Park Lions 2 (0) v (0) 0 Waverley Old Boys & Lokomtiv Cove 0 (0) v (1) 3 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2008 August 9/10 ]</h4><br />
	<p>Tess here, guest-wrapper. (Wikkidi-wah.) This Wrap is a combination of Saturday's and Sunday's matches, so let's start with Saturday:
	</p>
	<p>
	Despite some Porkers having a late night on Friday, the sun was shining for a great turn-out at 11am on Saturday. From the outset, our game was strong and composed, with many excellently-placed passes and quite a few shots on goal. In the first half, we finally scored, with Vicky striking a great goal into the corner of the net, converting Emma K's superb cross from the right wing into our first goal of the match.
	</p>
	<p>
	Halftime was 1-0, a position that we seem to seem to be in more often than not, so we knew how to deal with it! We dug our heels in for the second half and trotted (sorry) back onto the pitch.
	</p>
	Soon enough, Liz caught the keeper on the back foot and scored our second goal of the match. While Loco's heads started to drop and they were losing their fire, we remained composed. This paid off almost instantly, as the kick-off after the goal was converted into a third goal from a play right from the back, with Emma K scoring and hammering the final nail into Loco's coffin. One Loco went off injured, leaving them with only 10 and there was no stopping us now. Spirits high, we ended the match with a resounding 3-0 victory.
	</p>
	<p>
	Qua-li-tee!
	</p>
	<p>
	Sunday's game certainly was tougher, with the driving cold wind and rain during warm-up not making things any easier. We knew we were in for a tough match as Waverley had been doing well in the last couple of weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first half was an evenly matched battle, as Waverley tried to draw us into playing their game and we didn't manage to get many breaks. The rain didn't help at all, and we struggled to gain the composure that served us so well in our Saturday match. Despite all our best efforts, however, we trotted off (sorry) at half-time with the score still deadlocked at 0-0.
	</p>
	Not to be disheartened, though, we began the second half optimistic and ready to fight hard to create chances. Our hard work paid off about 10 minutes in, when Nicola's sterling corner kick was deflected by a Waverley defender into their own goal. Well done, Porkies! Of course, we were not going to rest on our laurels with a mere one-goal lead, and gritted our teeth to find our next. In the last 10 minutes of the match, this finally came in the form of a beautiful strike from Holly which sailed across the goal and into the net. Hooray for a 2-0 win!
	</p>
	<p>
	Girls (and Dougal), I think we should be really proud of our efforts this weekend, and it should give us quite a boost in the table. We're getting into a good position for finals time!
	</p>
	<p>
	As usual, please send your points to Amy for each of the weekend games - not to me! - and make sure you include your points for both Saturday and Sunday. Thanks and see you Tuesday night for training!
	</p>
	Cheers<br />
	Tess
	<p>
	great games guys! well done! we are definitely a team to beat!! once again i want to says thanks for being so supportive and helping out with my little monkeys!! it means so much to us! saige was a happy camper once we got back to the car and everything was more familiar to her! she is now soundly sleeping and seth continues to play with his planes and helicopters! looking forward to an early night tonight as i am totally buggered both physically and mentally!! have a fantastic week!! and thanks again...you guys rock!
hol xo 
	</p>
	<p>
	well hol- we think you rock! you truly are a supermum
and just for those who don't know glebe lost today meaning we are now top of the table -woo hoo
(have same points but better goal difference)
go porkies. Vicky.
xx
	</p>
	<p>
	Good wrap Tess....Perfec & Qual-i-tee!!!!!!
Such a great job this weekend girls, we should be proud, we were a calm bunch of little porkies and it paid off! Playing our own game is really what it's all about, as soon as we are drawn into petty arguments and booting the ball we lose our composure. BUT!!!!!! Not anymore! We have grown as a team and have great confidence in each other and in our ability to do what needs to be done!
 	</p>
 	<p>
If Vicky's calculations are correct (and I'm sure they are!) we are now top of the table......yippeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
 	</p>
 	<p>
Sorry to gush, but I think we're doing so well. We just need to keep it up for a couple more weeks and then.....THE FINALS!!!!!!
 	</p>
 	<p>
See you Tuesday.

	<h4><a name="match-16-08">Cooogee United 0 (1) v (1) 2 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2008 August 2 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Mighty, mighty Queens Park, from defence into attack, Mighty, mighty Queens Park!
 	</p>
	<p>
	A ripper of a game today team. We faced Coogee United with their division one goalie and that didn't stop us... or Emma K! Coach Dougal let A1 goalie know his thoughts right from the starting line, but it only made us more determined to work as a team and our efforts paid off.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Our team dynamics changed a little today seeing our two centre backs pushing up the field. Nic moving into the mid-field and Lady V having a crack at striker. Great job guys, it shows what a versatile team we can be. Emma K scored both our goals wrapping up the game at 2-0! It would have been interesting watching our game from the sideline as the first goal was celebrated with a pile of red and black players on top of Emma! The second goal was a team effort from new striker Vicky and Emma K who really sealed the deal for the Porkers.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	With a few out due to injuries it was strange to see our sideline with only 2 subs. Liz made a come back from an injured knee and hopefully won't pull up too bad in the morning and Nic unfortunately went down with a serious cramp mid way through the second half so Nic, and Liz keep us updated with your injury progress. And Karla and Emma C let us know how your ankle and neck are going too, we want and need everyone in tip-top shape for the up and coming finals series in a few weeks time.
 	</p>
	<p>
	The skill level shown today is a true reflection of our hard work and team effort, so please try and do your best to make it to training on Tuesday night, 7pm @ Barracluff Park Bondi. Marga I'll get you at 6.30pm and Anita & Karla let me know if you want a 6.45pm drive by pick-up.
 	</p>
	Hope the chocolate drive is going well, I would like to have the money by next Saturday as I won't be at the game on Sunday and the account needs to be paid early next week Thanks Guys. If you haven't given me the money so far, can you please give me an update when you send in your points as to how many you have/haven't sold so I can get a rough idea. Thanks everyone!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Also night out on Friday if you can/want to come. We had such a great time at The Lowenbrau for Dougal's birthday, I thought we'd go back there. Bring your other half and friends, I'll be there about 7-7.30pm and remember it gets busy so there will be a line up if you arrive too late!

	<h4><a name="match-15-08">Queens Park Lions 2 (1) v (0) 2 Lokomotiv </a> [ 2008 July 27 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Hi-ya Girls & Dougal
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Just finished dinner, I was starving as I didn't have any lunch.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Hope those that went to the pub had a few drinks for me and a nice big juicy steak! Sorry I couldn't make it but, I got caught in the rain at Bondi Junction buying my thermal gear for the northern winter.
	</p>
	<p> 
	The match got off to a bit of a bad start with Loco being very picky about line ropes etc. And to top it off there wasn't a ref, again. Sandra what channels do we need to go through to get our refs fees reimbursed to us, not to QP association?
	</p>
	<p> 
	Our game today finished in perfect time, weather-wise (slogging it out in the rain can be tough) We started strong against Loco, the team that is breathing down our necks on the competition ladder. Kellie began the match with a cracker goal, her first (Congratulations Kellie!) and that put us in good spirits. At half time, Tess insisted we played as if the scoreboard was 0-0, a wise thought. Loco's number 4 with a solid boot managed to level the score off her hard-as-a-rock corner kick. No time was wasted as Emma K got back to the grind and managed a beauty from the left side over the heads of many and inot the net to take the lead 2-1. It wasn't until the last 10 that Loco  who had resorted to rough play, managed to get a penalty inside the box. Again number 4 went for it, one-on-one against our Sam who tried her beast to stop the goal, but it wasn't to be and the full-time whistle kept us at a draw.
	</p>
	<p>	 
	Despite the draw, we played well and coach seemed happy, not sure if there will be a 'Dougal's Drone' at training on Tuesday but if there is, it will only help us to improve as a team and continue on our winning way. So remember to come along, it's not only good for fitness and skill, but we have a lot of fun too.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Thanks for sending through points, for those of you who couldn't make the game our winners from last week were: 3rd place - Annette, 2nd place - Emma K and 1st place with the most points ever scored in one match... Nicola! Well done girls keep up the great work, and keep sending those points in.
	</p>
	<p> 
	The chocolate drive is going well, Marga, Dougal and Annette were the first to return their monies, thanks guys. Also we have 2 boxes leftover, we can send them back, but I thought I'd ask if anyone could sell some more, or maybe your other half could, no pressure, Cadbury will take the leftovers back if they don't sell. A total box is worth $48 in case you have forgotten
	</p>
	<p> 
	Our game next week is at Heffron at 9am, hopefully it won't be too chilly! See you all there at 8.15am.
	</p>
	<p>
	Have a super week and see you on Tuesday.
	</p> 
	<p>

	PS The night out with my friend from Ireland will be on Friday 8th August, as he arrives that day from Alice Springs, I know it's the double weekend but it doesn't have to be a late night, bring partners, friends, whoever you like. Any suggestions of where to go? I want to go somewhere in The Rocks.
	</p>	
	<h4><a name="match-14-08">Maroubra 1 (0) v (1) 1 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2008 July 20 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Hey Guys
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Today we had a tough match with Maroubra (not our favourite team) as per usual we didn't have a ref so Maroubra supplied one, I would say... 16 tops! Hopefully we don't have to play them again this season, especially in the finals series as we can be easily rattled by them.
	</p>
	<p> 	
	The game started with a cracker goal from Nicola, who ran and ran and ran for the full 90 minutes, you deserved that beer after the game! and we managed to keep hold of the lead until the final 10 minutes when Maroubra sent a goal flying into the net to level the score 1-1 at full time. So our record with Maroubra stands at a win, a loss and 2 draws; we definitely have more team spirit that would lift us over the line should we have to meet with them again in the near future.
	</p>
	<p> 	
	Special mention to Emma K for coming at half time, she left a very important meeting with the pontiff (we'll say she represented all of us!!!) to make it to the game.
	</p> 
	<p>
	Send through your points when you can we are nearly at the end of the season and the 'players player' award will be given to someone so every point counts.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Training on Tuesday, Coach Dougal is doing a fab job and we have really improved as a team this season, so come along and join in, we even got to play fun games last week!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Have a great week<br />
	Amy (I have to go back to work tomorrow, I'm quite sad!)
	</p>
	<p> 
PS Thanks for taking the chocolate boxes, remember I need the money back to me by Tuesday 12 August to pay the final bill. If you can sell more, I have 4 spare boxes!
	</p>
	<h4><a name="match-13-08">Queens Park Lions 4 (3) v (0) 0 Glebe</a> [ 2008 July 13 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Aren't we a happy little bunch of porkers! I have to admit that I started the wrap at midnight (red text), as I was feeling a little 'posamistic', what was that thing if you put it out there it will happen, was it called the secret or something? Anyhow it worked, along with our exceptional skills, hard work and training sessions.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Glebe...Glebe...Glebe! We need to go out and drink more often team! We did it, we beat them fair and square, so look out finals, here we come!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Taking a step back into the weekend, I have to say what a fantastic night out we had on Friday. I'm sure you would agree if you were there and if you couldn't make it we will have another night out soon, I'm working on it. Hope you enjoyed your birthday bash coach and your Big Macs too. Saturday night was trivia and some of us found our way to North Bondi Surf Club to raise money for their women's surf crew. QP Red v QP Black which proved to be tough competition, but does anyone know who won out of our teams? I think Black may have just pipped the Reds at the post!!!
	</p> 
	So back to Sunday! A warm, sunny day followed by a cool afternoon breeze allowed for a good match. Both teams were hungry for victory, but no-one was going to mess with us porkers! We managed to take the game convincingly at 4-0, something our whole team can and should be very proud of. The first goal couldn't have been any 'nita', a lovely high kick into the net gave us the start we needed. Two following goals were scored by Liz (her first this season) and Emma K before half time. Holly added one more to her tally early in the second half, well done goal scorers! Glebe's supporters decided to take it easy and 'kill a case' on the sideline, I'm not sure they were expecting us to be as tough as we were. The Glebe players were frustrated and managed to fall apart at the seems due to QP's strong team spirit.
	</p> 
	<p>
	For points this week we are going to 'double up' as it is really hard to choose between players, everyone had such a great game, so you can put 2 names for each (3pts, 2pts & 1pt) remember to send through your points when you can. Last weeks porker award went to Marga (I will give it to you on Tuesday).
	</p> 	
	<p>
	Coach Dougal, thanks for all of your planning and hard work so far this season, we have improved as a team immensely and we couldn't have done it with our you. Happy Birthday for Wednesday!
	</p>
	<p>
	Well I am now 10 minutes late for church, so I better get my skates on and pray for another successful round next week. Have a super week and see you all at training on Tuesday night, 7pm at Barracluff Park, Bondi (in case you've forgotten).
	</p> 
	<p>	
	Amy x
 	</p>
 	<p>
P.S. I am going to organise our Cadbury chocolate fundraiser this week, some people were a little concerned about raising money for our night out, but heaps of teams do it I've had to do it for netball lots of times, but if you are uncomfortable or unable to sell the chocs let me know and no questions will be asked. Cheers!
	</p>
	<p> 
P.P.S Thanks to our sideline supporters for coming to watch, we love having you there!
 	</p>
 	<p>
P.P.P.S Now I am 15 minutes late!

	<h4><a name="match-12-08">Waverley Old Boys 2 (1) v (2) 4 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2008 July 6 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Oh what a great Sunday it was! You can't get much better than a gorgeous, sunny day in July with a keen and eager team ready to take another victory from Waverley! We may have sung the wrong second verse (sorry Nic) but our new Queens Park song got us started with lifted spirits and good team moral.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Suprisingly we actually had a ref (he looked like he just stepped straight out of 1970). I couldn't believe his casual attitude towards handballs and tackling but it was too funny when he blew the whistle when Karla ran on the field before the other player came off!!! Where do they find these people? I also have to make mention of the fact that he insisted on us tucking our shirts in and checking the studs on our boots!
	</p>
	<p> 	
	The game got off to a positive start we were the first goal scorers by the help of a Waverley forward (this seems to be a habit of theirs when we play them but we won't complain). I have awarded Karla with the goal as she was closest, what do they say... right place, right time, well done Karla.
	</p>
	<p> 
	At half time, coach Dougal's oranges gave us the extra juice needed to continue the lead into the second half. We had reverted back a little to 'booting the ball' but when you had A'man'da running at you it was easy to see why!!! I'm sure some of you are sporting several bruises from the very tall and often pushy opposition. 
	</p>
	<p> 
	Have to make mention of Anita's great effort in goal, she came out of the box to help in defense and at times it was like what is she doing? But her cool, clam and collected nature was spot on. Our super mid-fielder Holly gave her all (as usual) and notched up 3 goals for the team and we managed to take the game 4-2! A great win which topped off the morning.
	</p>
	<p> 
	But it didn't end there!!! The afternoon was spent on The Avenue with super-cook Karla and her assistant Anita hosting the best taco social. For some of us the afternoon turned into evening, night and morning! Thanks guys for your hospitality it was a great day and everyone enjoyed themselves, Karla you will have to share your recipes. Let's hope the porker award will be back on his feet soon after being near drowned in the sangria!
	</p>
	<p> 
	Sandra, Vicky and I have started thinking about the end-of-season do we are thinking of having a more casual BBQ, somewhere local first and then heading out, rather than a dinner as that can sometimes be a bit too formal and hard to get around to have a chat etc... so we will keep you posted. A thought also came up about doing some fundraising, in the past I have organised a cadbury chocolate drive for us to raise money to fund our food and drink for the social (although you tell the people buying it's to raise money for new uniforms or something of the sort!) I am happy to do this again so can you let me know if you would be happy/able to do this when you send through your points, The box has about 50 freddos/caramello koalas in them to sell @ $2 each. Ta!
	</p>
	<p> 
	I haven't received any points from anyone yet, which is very unusual I normally open my Macbook to find heaps before I even do the wrap, so Karla and Anita that must mean that people really, really enjoyed themselves yesterday!
	</p>
	<p> 
	We have a busy soccer weekend coming up... Dougal's birthday on Friday night, Trivia on Saturday night and a 3pm game on Sunday against Glebe, so rest up this week and hope to see you all Friday! Except Marga who will be spending the weekend in beautiful Byron Bay, have a great weekend and we hope to give you the good news of a win on Sunday.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Enjoy the week, Sandra and I are on holidays for the next two weeks (hahaha!) so if anyone is around to catch up let us know.

	<p>
	Hi all,
	</p>
	<p>
	I was disapponited we didn't come away with a win today, but then I thought about it (after a hot shower, hot food and a glass of wine of course!
	If you think about it we're on a roll really....the second half of last week was the best we'd played in quite a while, and today it seemed as if everyone was pushing all the time, even though we were tired, and there was some great talking and passing. 
	If we'd played any other team with a different goalie, we probably would have ended up with 6 goals. So, in reality, if we continue to play like we did today, we will beat every team in our division (starting with Waverly next week)
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Some interesting news for you...I had a stickybeak at Coogee 1st division to see how many goals this goalie has let in this year.....she's let in 1 goal only!!!!!!!!!! and that's against 1st division players, so we did an awesome job and we tested her and came soooooo close on so many occasions.
	We are still in the top 4, regardless of results from other teams today, so the finals are definetely in our grasp, but let's not relax and let's keep on being hungry for wins and remain positive and enjoy our games!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Keep it up mighty Queens Park, we're getting back to our best
	</p>
	<p> 
	See you Tuesday ( a little late....parent teacher interviews aghhhhh)<br />
	Sandra
	</p>
	<p>
	nice one sandra!! lovely to hear the positive talk!! i love playing with you guys and totally makes my tiring week end really good!! and yes i think we would have scored many many goals...she was their star and they should feel very lucky for pulling off the draw today! now let's keep our heads high and keep smiling and talking!! good work everyone!! and sandra i wish i could say i have had a hot shower ( i haven't ) a good glass of wine ( i haven't) and some hot food ( not yet) !!! oh the joys of motherhood...heehee!!
take care and work hard this week!!</p>

	<p>
	Hey All
 	</p>
 	<p>
	I hope you enjoyed your lunch at the Cloey and had a few bites for me... I love their food!!!
	</p>
	<p> 	
	I think I would be speaking for most of the team when I say the second half of today's game was definitely better than the first, we played with greater gusto and settled the ball well, having plenty of shots on net. Unfortunately none turned into goals, and 'Loco' took the win (1-0). I don't think they won because of better skill as we certainly showed them we were a worthwhile side, therefore I'll say it was a lucky day for them.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Today we farewelled our Boston-bound right-wing Rebekah. Thank you for being a great team player and we hope that you enjoyed playing with us this season. Safe travels for you and your family, let us know when you'll be back later in the year, you might even be around for our end-of-season do.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Just a short snippet of encouragement, last week every player that took the field was awarded points for one reason or another, this shows what a great team we are and that your team mates are watching!!! Send them through when you get the chance.
 	</p>
	<p>
	I won't be at training on Tuesday as I am going on school camp to Bathurst for 3 days with 96 eleven/twelve year olds. It will be fun, cold, hard work, tiring, fun, cold, hard work, tiring... did I mention cold??? I am then off to the Blue Mountains to climb the 1000 stairs on the weekend, but I'll be back for our 3pm game on Sunday.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Have a great week and have fun at training!

	<h4><a name="match-9-08">Queens Park Lions 2 (2) v (1) 3 Maroubra</a> [ 2008 Jun 15 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	I now feel much better, I have just had a lovely, hot bath to thaw my very numb body!
	</p>
	<p> 
	Our game today was a bit of a mud wrestle and we all know that it probably wasn't our best. We had tough conditions, no ref and a supporter of the opposition who suffered badly from very loud verbal diarrhoea!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Play started strong as players got a feel for the soggy pitch. The first goal was awarded to Maroubra, but was levelled by Holly shortly after who was determined to get one before she left at half time, and what a great goal it was too! We backed up again to be the next goal scorers with Karla scoring her first goal for Queens Park. At this stage we were still trying hard to play hard and strong but unfortunately Maroubra evened the score at 2-2. They then managed to score once more in the last 30 seconds of the match, a real nail in the coffin.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Dougal took on the job of referee, a very difficult task especially against Maroubra, thank you and we know it makes your job as coach much harder. We had a sideline clipboard monitor in Ky who helped out with subs etc... thanks Ky!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	To make the match sux even more, we then  had to pack up the field in the rain and mud, thanks all who stayed to help out.
	</p>
	<p> 	
	Our Queens Porker award from the last match we played was a tight competition between 3 players, until someone put there points in at the last minute and the award was given to Vicky.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Please send your points in and hope to see you at training on Tuesday and/or Bek's drinks on Friday night (I'll be there after my school's disco - yay!)

	Have a great week!

	<h4><a name="match-8-08">Queens Park Lions 1 (0) v (0) 1 Waverley Old Boys</a> [ 2008 Jun 1 ]</h4><br />
	<p>
	Hey everyone,
	</p>
	<p> 
	Tess here, guest columnist for the Sunday Wrap, as Amy asked me to write up the match this week. Hopefully I do as good a job as her - if not, she'll be back next week. Also I hope I've included everyone in this – if I haven't, please forward it on to anyone else.
	</p>
	<p>
	It was a dramatic and tense game this week. With no referee in sight (again), Dougal gallantly took the reigns and steered the game with a fair hand. The rain held off until the very end, thankfully, though there was a bit of wind that made kicks a bit unpredictable, and the ball was going out – well out – the sidelines a lot.
	</p>
	<p> 
	There was a bit of a rocky start to the match, and we took a bit of time to settle into it. We got into it though, and by the end of the first half there was some excellent passing between the midfields and forwards. We had a lot of chances and quite a few shots, but unfortunately none of them were going in. We came off at half-time with the score still 0-0.
	</p>
	<p> 
	The half-time break saw the presentation of the Queen's Porker award, which has been given a stunning redesign and now looks very professional. Congrats to Bek for winning it the week before last, and to Kellie and Holly as joint Porkers from last week.
	</p>
	<p> 
	We went into the second half with spirits up, ready to score and chalk up the win. Unfortunately, it was Waverley who scored the first goal of the game, being awarded a penalty from a handball in the area. Even Sam's impressive, full-length dive couldn't quite reach the ball, which went into the lower corner of the net. After that, we had to work to keep our heads up and keep positive about the game. We didn't have to work for too long, because Bek evened the score with a beautiful goal (slightly deflected off a Waverley defender, but let's not go into that!).
	</p>
	<p> 
	By the middle of the second half, Dougal was copping a fair bit from the Waverley players and bench. Well done Dougal for keeping your cool – it's not a fun job! But after all our best efforts, we didn't manage to score again, and the game ended 1-1.
	</p>
	<p> 	
	We were all a bit disappointed by the result, but I think we did a great job coming back from 1-0 down. Team spirit was at an all-time high, especially from the bench. Thanks to Nic, Sandra, Karla and Amy (and various other team family members) for coming down and cheering us on, it was a great help!
	</p>
	<p>
	Don't forget to send your points for the new, improved Porker award to Amy (not me!). See you at training tomorrow night!
	</p>
 	Cheers <br />

	<p>hi guys!!</p>
	<p>
	just wanted to say thanks for helping me with the kids this morning!! seth is still talking about 'bicky' and 'marga'...it means a lot to know that i have a team who is willing to help out so much in order for me to play!! you guys rock!! sorry to have left so quickly...we had a busy rest of the morning...swimming and then both kids fell asleep in the car...just home and everyone is happy!! good game today too...passing was spectacular...hope you all enjoy the rest of your sunday....thanks again. cheers hol xoxo</p>
	<p>
	Here, here....we are a fantastic team!!!!<br />
	I know we all had an outstanding game, defence clearing everything, midfield running & running and using the wings, and forwards creating some awesome chances and passing like pros, but I reckon our best feature is our TEAM SPIRIT...Honestly, you don't hear our team being nasty to each other, everyone is super encouraging and helpful (as seen today with the fabulous babysitters) <br />
	Let's keep up the great team spirit (and listen to Dougal's coaching of course!) and we'll be holding up the trophy at the end of the season before we know it! <br />
	See you all on Tuesday <br />
	Sandra
	</p>
	<p>
    Today's wrap will have to be quite short, sorry all, but Sandra did a pretty good one herself and I have school reports to write which I keep putting off!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	We played extremely well in our early morning match, the crisp weather got us running and running and running in the first half and we were rewarded with a goal before half time, thanks Holly! Holly managed to take another goal in the second half which allowed us to take the game 2-0.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	The morning had some memorable moments, certainly Holly's two goals but how can we miss Kellie's delicate removal of the ball from under the Coogee girl who was grounded! And also Annette's 'pile-up', both were very funny.
	</p> 
	<p>
	Thanks everyone for a great game, our skills at training definitely paid off.
	</p>
	<p> 
	Remember to send through your points (3,2,1)... I forgot to announce the Queen's Porker award from last week. Our winner was... Bek! Well done, Karla and Anita one of you need to remember the trophy to pass on.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	See you all on Friday night for Sandra's birthday bash if you can make it.

	<p>
	Hi Girls… and Dougal!
	</p>
	<p> 
	So sorry that the Sunday Wrap is 3 days late, but I have been very busy, were does the time go?
 	</p>
 	<p>
	It was great to come away on Sunday afternoon with a win, a big improvement on the week before.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	We had a cracker goal from Bek and plenty of attempts from our forwards as well, Liz you nearly got your first header goal!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Holly, it was great to have you back and true to form you spent half of your game time on the ground!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	The game also saw some stunning fancy footwork from Karla, she is determined to score a goal by kicking the ball back over her head… a feat I’m sure she will conquer before the season is out.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Last night at training (a great session) Dougal talked us through Sunday’s game and areas where we can improve… thankfully he only focussed on one as we would still be there I think! No only joking, we are working really well together and it was positive to have most of the team at training. We practiced taking the ball forward and passing the ball off between the midfielders and forwards, rather than one person taking the ball all over the countryside alone (did I get that right Dougal, please correct me if I missed the point of the entire evening!)
	</p> 
	<p>
	Let’s hope we can put our training into play this Sunday (it’s an early one… 9am!) when we have a team racing and attacking.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Please send through your points, the winner of the Queens Porky Award was announced at last Sunday’s game and that was… if you weren’t there… drum roll… ANITA – a great game!
	</p>
	<p> 
	The season is powering through pretty quickly and fingers crossed we won’t be held up by any more rainy Sunday’s. So enjoy each game and give 100% because it might be over before you know it.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Remember our social night/s. Sandra’s birthday drinks are on next Friday 30th at Paddington and our team social is Friday 6th June (Long weekend), Vicky have you decided on a venue for us yet?
 	</p>
	<p>
	Thanks everyone. Over and out,

	<h4><a name="match-5-08">Maroubra  2 (0) v  (2) 2 Queens Park Lions </a> [ 2008 May 11 ]</h4><br />
	<p>First things first... Happy Mothers Day to all Mums and Happy 1st Wedding Anniversary to Vicky and Dougal, the champers was a lovely treat.</p>
	<p>Well our game today was filled with very mixed emotions. For starters we had more than a problem or two with the ref, a little suspicious that she was wearing a Maroubra t-shirt. I don't know how she made calls at each goal end when she only walked around the centre circle!!! Unfortunately with women's soccer we have to be grateful that someone even volunteered. I am going to email Julius about our 'situation' as I think our ref money would be better spent on a few bottles of vino at our end of year celebration!!!
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Even though it ended a draw, we played extremely well in the first half, with 2 goals being scored. Our first goal was a perfectly timed cross from Emma K to Chrissy who tapped the ball into the left side of the net with ease. The second goal was just as great this time from Emma K herself. Lou (old goalie) was never going to get back in time for that one. Well done girls! Unfortunately we kinda thought the half time whistle was full time and we let our guard down a little (sorry if that's being harsh!) and Maroubra came back to level the score. I guess we can look at it as, a draw is better than a loss hey?
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Even though it won't go down in the record books as one of our better games, we did have a few great passes, kicks and plays. Anita it was great to see you running and running and running! You took a few tumbles, I hope that you don't find too many bruises tomorrow. And Nic we all know how hard you tried to save that goal too.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Thanks to those who have already sent points in, it is great to see the spread of points each week, the 'players player' award will certainly be a tight race by the end of the season... keep the points coming.
 	</p>
	<p>
	A little 'social' update... remember Sandra's birthday drinks on Friday 30th May, Durty Nelly's at Paddington and out soccer social (all partners/friends) welcome on 6th June. Vicky is sourcing our venue so stay tuned for an update.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Breaking news (pardon the pun) from last weeks game... The girls who tripped over Vicky's boots ended up with a broken collarbone and the other girl spent a week on crutches! Well done Queens Park for staying on your feet! Just a reminder that if you are injured whilst playing the insurance is pretty lame so it is recommended that you take out your own private insurance, this is a personal choice of course.
 	</p>
	<p>
	Well training is back on on Tuesday night, I hope the rain that is forecast holds off. I will let you know if I can make it, we have that psychologist for the next 2 Tuesday nights but I not sure if I still need to go.
 	</p>
 	<p>
	Our Queens Porker Award has been renamed the Queen's Porky Award fo season 2008, Our Players Player winner for last week was Sam, congratulations!
 	</p>
	<p>
	Have a great week everyone and see you Tuesday and/or Sunday at Queens Park 3pm.

	<p>Well I wish that I was writing this a little happier, but I'm sorry to say that I'm not. I have to apologise for the handball, even though I am positive that it hit my arm above my elbow! Sorry Sam and team : (
</p> 
<p>
We started the game with good spirits and managed to hold a 0-0 score at half time. The opposition were loosing payers fast, 2 had already left the field through injury, but despite our efforts we were unable to convert our hard work into points. 
 </p>
<p>
They may hold top place on the leader board (I think), but I'm sure it won't be for long!!!
</p> 
<p>
Thanks to Holly for bringing the crew down to say hello. Girl you are amazing, you look so fit and healthy, we are really looking forward to your 2008 comeback. Also to Liz for stopping by in her high heels to cheer us on in the second half.
</p>
<p> 
Thanks for those who have already sent points in for yesterday. The Queens Porker will be awarded to the highes point scorrer on Sunday.

<p>
As for our night out, the date has changed as Vicky & Nic were unable to make it. The date now is Friday June 6th, I will be very keen to celebrate, it's my class assembly that day and as the teachers in the team will know what a relief it is to have your class assembly over and done with! So put the date in your diary.
 </p>
 <p>
Sorry I won't be at training on Tuesday, I have the pleasure of listening to a child psychologist for 2 hours about parenting, fun, fun, fun! 
 </p>

Happy Mother's Day to Holly and Bec for Sunday, have a great day. And to all your mum's as well.

	<h4><a name="match-3-08">Waverley Old Boys 0 (0) v (0) 2 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2008 Apr 27 ]</h4><br />

	<p>Well what a game!</p>
 
	<p>The past few weeks have been rained out so it was good to get back on the paddock, especially Vicky who made her 2008 debut. A few of us were a 	little under the weather after stepping of international flights, Sandra you are a trooper, arriving home off a 14 hour flight and getting to the 	park pretty much on time. A fab effort!</p>
 
	<p>We had just enough players to field a full team and as there weren't any subs, it was just a case of grit your teeth, dig your heels in and 	don't whinge. Waverley on the other hand had enough for 2 teams, but the QP spirit didn't let that scare them, we played hard and were glad to 	come away with a great win. Our first goal was courtesy of No. 9 from Waverley, it was a header of Bek's cross into the left side of the net. The 	second goal was nothing less than talent and skill from Nicola's right boot, cool, calm and collected she ran onto the ball and made a very 	graceful shot into the back of the net.</p>
 	
	<p>
	Again everyone made a gallant effort to achieve a great result (I hope that will keep our top of the table slot for another week) and we decided 	to celebrate our win with a beer (at 11am!) at Fox studios.
	</p>

	<p>Thanks to Emma C for coming along to support us. Hope your neck gets better quickly and you will be able to join us on the pitch.</p>
 
	<p>Our social is set for Friday 30 May and we are going to make The Fox + Lion (at Fox studios) our starting base. You can order food from the 	kitchen as you like and bring along anyone you want. We'll say around 7-7.30pm.</p>
 
	<p>Remember to send through your points as I want to be able to award the highest point scorer each week at training with our 'Queens Porker' 	Award.</p>
 
	<p>Next week we start the rounds over again and we play Glebe Wanderers at QP 26 @ 3pm. Remember to fill in the blog if you can't make it. 	Otherwise see you at training on Tuesday night.</p>
 
	Cheers<br />

	Hi All
 
	<p>Sorry the Sunday Wrap is being done on Monday! Also it will have to be short... I have 75 school projects to get marked before I leave for Hawaii on Friday and I have 2 shows to watch tonight plus 2 from last night... gee time flies!</p>
 
	<p>Yesterday's game was a fabulous effort, I arrived just before half time, off the train from my nephew's 1st birthday in Newcastle to find that we were in front on the scoreboard of Nic's old club Maroubra, 2-1. The first goal being scored by Emma K, a great effort, and another by Nicola, so I am told (please let me know if my stasts are wrong... for the records!). The score was levelled early in the second half despite an awesome effort by Anita (I never knew you were so talkative, it was great, keep it up). Our third goal came from the ever so cool, calm and collected mid-fielder and team captain, Sandra. This goal gave us all renewed faith in our super soccer ability and a glimmer of hope for our first win. Luckily a win was in sight and came our way via an own goal... bounce of Emma K so we'll let her have it. Full time whistle went and Queens Park 2008 were the happiest team ever, nothing like a win to lift the spirits.</p>
 
	<p>The game was then celebrated by a few drinks at the Robin Hood Hotel (what time did you girls finish up???) I was very good and left after one drink to go to Church, I promise I'll stay longer next time.</p>
 
	<p>A date for you diary... We have decided that Friday 30th May will be the date for our first official 'big nightout' team social. Not sure of details yet but please keep it free, we are planning well in advance (and a Friday!) so that everyone should be able to make it. Sandra and I will let you know what's happening when we return from sunny Hawaii, hahaha!</p>
 
	<p>Please send your points through to me for the game and remember that we have 2 Emmas and a Nic and Nicola, if you don't let me know which one, I'll have to skip your points, sorry.</p>
 
	<p>While I'm away, still send your points to me, but is anyone able to do the Sunday Wrap for the next 2 matches? Sandra, Liz and I would love to hear what is going on while we are away.</p>
 
	<p>Thank you to Michael Wixted (Sandra's husband) for being our referee, its not an easy job when you know one of the teams, but as always he did a great fill-in job and we really appreciated it. Thanks Michael.</p>
 
	<p>I hear that training is on on Thursday, unfortunately, I won't be able to make it... Have a very long appointment at Leah's Waxworks (ouch!) in preparation for the summer weather in Hawaii!</p>
 
Take care and enjoy the next few weeks. Looking forward to hearing news from the pitch.<br />

PS I guess it wasn't that short after all!
	
	<h4><a name="match-1-08">Glebe 1 (1) v (0) 1 Queens Park Lions</a> [ 2008 Mar 30 ]</h4><br />
	Hi All
 
	<p>The Sunday Wrap is back for season 2008! I Hope you enjoy it.</p>
 
	<p>Well today was our first game of the season and we started with fresh legs and many new faces. Welcome back to the old crew and welcome to those who are new to the team for 2008, you've picked a great team to play with!</p>
 
	<p>Also for those of you who Know Holly McClean (Season 2007), Congratulations to Holly, Dave and Seth on the birth of Saige last week. Holly, hope you're well and enjoying motherhood second time round. Are you coming back???</p>
 
	<p>Our game today at Heffron against Glebe was pleasing to say the least. As a new team, we did well just to learn each others names by half time!</p>
 
	<p>With strict instructions from absentee coach Dougal (We hope that you and Vicky are enjoying the sun and relaxing in Asia with a few maitais) all players played with grit and determination and subbed well from the sideline.</p>
 
	<p>Play was very competitive in the first half as was the sun... I am now sporting a very red and shiny forehead. The backs were under the guidance of Nik who did a great job of commanding the backline, keeping defence tight. Our mid-fielders ran and ran and ran and kept the ball in the oppositions half more often than not. Our forwards had many opportunities on net and unfortunately only missed by what looked like inches. The first goal was scored by Glebe halfway through the second half, but in true Queens Park spirit, we didn't give up and we triumphed 5 minutes before full time and equalled the score 1-1, with thanks to Bek's super header into the left side of the net. I must admit I thought the goalie had caught it and I was clapping her great save until I saw half the team cheering and running about madly, my eyesight isn't the best! And finally to Sam, our superstar, spectacular goalie, where did we find you and what took us so long? Sam was on fire in net and collected enough grass to prove that she ALWAYS puts her body on the line. Thanks for yelling and telling us where to go, we loved it and keep it up.</p>
 
	<p>So to finish at full time 1-1, we should be very happy. The ref was friendly and I think he knew most of our names by the end of the game. Let's hope we actually have one that turns up each week!</p>
 
	<p>Players Player Award:<br />
 
	<p>At our end of the year team social, we have lots of fun and hand out awards. One of those is the 'Players Player' award. Each week you play you need to award points to players (3 points, 2 points and 1 point) for those you think deserve them. If you could email me your names/points I will tally them up and keep a record for the end of the year as well as a goal tally.</p>
 
	<p>Next week we play at Queens Park at 3pm and afterwards we thought it would be great to go and have a beginning of season drink at the Clovelly Hotel (don't bother changing we just go as we are). We'll see on Tuesday night who can make it, feel free to invite partners/friends if you like.</p>
 
	<p>Sandra and I will be trying to organise a team social in May, but I'll get back to you about that one later!</p>
 
	<p>Thanks and see you all at training, 7pm on Tuesday night at Baracluff Park, if you can make it.</p>

PS The Sunday Wraps won't always be this long... I promise!
