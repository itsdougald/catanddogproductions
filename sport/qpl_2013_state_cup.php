        <h2>Queens Park Lions' State Cup match Reports 2013</h2>
		<h4><a name="round-01">Queens Park Lions 0 (0) v (3) 4 Brookvale Reserves</a> [ 2013 May 21]</h4>
		Hello Queens Park Admirers,

The Porkies hit the road this weekend to play the Brookvale Reserves in Avalon, an hour and a half north of Sydney!

With all but dearest Gill, EK, and Emma G in attendance the team donned our much anticipated NEW KIT, which flaunts a very risqué plunging neckline. Hey, maybe they'll increase the number of our supporters?

Anyway, the sky was blue and pitch green and it was a good day to play!  It was evident from the first five minutes of play that Queens Park was by far the better team, and was once again working like a well-oiled machine.

The first 45 was spent predominantly in the opposition's half, with the super-star back line feeding balls though expertly to the attack.  Finally our hard work paid off when Yee scored off of a pass from Maurisa.  Wooohooooo!

The Brookies were getting annoyed, and bickering with each other.  We knew we had them but had to seal the deal.  Brianne did just that when she laid the ball off to Aly who shot... and it rebound off the keeper to Maurisa who again assisted a goal when she passed it to B, who slotted the ball easily into the corner.  Woohoo again!

Half-time.  We congregate around Dougal (or was it the chocolate in front of him?) to talk strategy and get pumped up.

This time around we are headed into the sun, but other than that the play looks pretty similar to the first half.  Lots of shots and attacks!  Poor Deano was lonely in her net but the rest of us were pretty happy.

Finally Emma C got in on the action when she landed a well-deserved goal off of an expert through-ball from Yee at the 18-yard line.  Woohoo thrice?

Our fourth and final Woohoo was earned by none other than Tenacious Tess, who amazed us all with a slam-dunk shot from the top of the box.  Woohoo the quatro!

The game ended on an especially high note for me when my fantastic Family in Red sang me the Happy Birthday song and we all got to chow down on another of Cazablanket's delectable cake creations along with my girlfriend's amazing chic chip banana muffins.  Thanks guys!

The Porkies continued on to the famous Newport Hotel, recommended by Brianne and her lovely family, where fun and food was had by all.

So round 2 went well, and we'll proceed on to round 3, TBA for June.

We continue with conference games on Thursday, when QP will verse the Bra Girls at Coral Sea for a good ol' night game.  Fingers crossed the weather keeps, they are predicting rain eek!

Luuurve,
Aly

QP vs Griffith - Quarter Finals
 
With Ronnie back in action, Brianne now out of action, and Tess still out of action, 11 of us met in Manly to play another round of State Cup games.  Thankfully, Griffith came to us instead of us coming to them as its a 7 hour drive!
 
We started out strong, and stayed that way for 90 minutes. 
 
*DISCLAIMER - Sorry guys - I'm a bit foggy on the details so if I get them wrong I will amend later.  Thankfully Emma G does pay attention and has helped me out.*
 
Dirty Deans brought  a squeaky clean blond 'do, and some ferocity from the back that really pumped the team up! 
 
With Vhari, Lady V, Ronnie, and Caz representing the back line; Yee, Alana, EK, and Aly speed demon-ing in the middle; and Emma G and Jen kicking around in attack, the team formed a united front against a younger, fit, but mentally weaker Griffith.
 
The first big break came when Yee was fouled after a hard-earned run up the left side and into the box.  Ronnie-size made scoring look oh-so-easy when she planted the ball firmly into the net.  We really got a boost then - we might just be able to pull this off guys!
 
Then, after a serious of attacks and a corner awarded to QP, Emma G trotted over to get the ball for Aly, who tipped a short corner to Emma G, who fed the ball back to Aly, who then lofted it over the jumping players, past the grasping hand of the keeper, and into the top 90.  Ohhh Yea!  With a  team-wide celebration we trotted back into out half to maintain our lead.
 
Griffith didn't go out without a fight and we had some scary attempts on our own Dirty Deans who wasn't having a bean of it.  In one scary corner, the opposition pinged the ball off of our top post, onto the goal line, and just as Ronnie is winding up to scissor kick the ball away, Deans is yelling KEEPER!  It was tense, but at the end of the day the ball didn't go in and Deans and Ronnie hugged it out.
 
For the final finish, Ronnie-size again represented by expertly placing the ball over the defensive line and into the path of speedy Emma G (who was not off-side, much to the ANGST of the other coach) who drove the ball into the box and, cool as a cucumber, flicked the ball over the keeper and into the net.
 
And so we made it through the weekend unscathed and on top!
 
The team trotted off the Manly Wharf to celebrate the win with a drinky drink to two.
 
 
 
Stay tuned for another action-packed weekend.  We've got two make-up games with Mascot and then UNSW to bring us up-to-date with the comp. 
 
Cheerios,
Aly

<h4><a name="round-0">Queens Park Lions 1 (0) v (2) 2 Albion Park</a> [ 2013 ]</h4>
Hello!
 
After a series of unfortunate events, namely ridiculous amounts of rain for over 8 days, Queens Park now has missed a ton of games!  But we finally got back into it this Sunday when we played our State Cup semi-finals against Albion Park.
 
With a lean mean team of 13 we had Dirty Deans out back, representin' for Blond Bombshells of the world; Caza blanket, Ronnie-Size, Alana Banana, Lady V, and Vhari  (do we have a funny name for her yet, apart from the obvious Braveheart references?) in the back; Aly, Emma G, Tess, Yee, and EK running our bums off in the middle; and Maurisa and Emma C both back from overseas at the tippy top!    
We started, to be honest, a bit on our heels against a very tall, strong AP.  As a result our opponents popped two very quick ones into our net, one a brilliant cross and header that would've been near-impossible to stop.   
 
True to the QP spirit, we weren't beat and came back fighting!  Amazing left-boot EK put us back in the game with an epic shot from outside of the box, woohooooo!
 
The rest of the game was a very even battle, but QP definitely had the edge with possession and many near attempts.  One such resulted in Maurisa diving for the ball which was ON THE LINE in the opposition's goal but sadly after a scramble the ball bounced back out.  Frustration!
 
So, after 90 very tough minutes, a completely knackered Queens Pork trotted off the field with a 2-1 loss.  Not the best outcome, but we are proud of making it to the semis of the State Cup, farther that any of the other Eastern Suburbs teams!
 
We made our way over to the Randy Wicks to have a jolly drink or two at the Couch and Horse (get it Dougal?).  We then remained there for hours as all of us were too sore to get up again. 
 
Next up is a series of make-up games but we are officially into Round 2 of our season which means we'll be playing only Div 1 teams now, so stay tuned for some competitive action!
 
Porque love,
Aly
