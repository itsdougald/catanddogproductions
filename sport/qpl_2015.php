        <h2>Queens Park Lions' match Reports 2015</h2>
        
		<h4><a name="match-13"></a> [ 2015 Jul 26]</h4>
		G'day,

Who is that team in the black and red but not white...mighty mighty Queens Park!!

I am so glad I have nothing to do with Coogee United.

Every time we play the "Clams" it makes me feel so proud to be a Porky. They hack, swear and play crap football. I mean, they really do. They're also not shy in turning on each other loudly on the field. Disgraceful.

I just had to get that off my chest now. Right now.

So 3pm, QP on pitch (whatever the number is - it changes every year like every different swear word out of a Coogee Clam mouth!).

Summer is knocking on the door and boy it's exciting. 

The air was warm but the wind was strong.

With 13 very eager Porkies, had our keeper sorted out from the start, with "Hipster" Lydia kindly putting her Porky hoof up for the whole game - thank you replied the other 12 Porksters.

Bizzarely we didn't have a ref but with minutes to go, had two. One who offered had the wit of a clown. AS we know clowns are normally silent  who normally wouldn't talk - I think we all agreed he should have kept his mouth closed. Awkward! Luckily the allocated ref pushed him aside and took control. Phew.

What a game.

Conditions made it tough for both sides. 

The Porkies were so hot and quick out of the blocks we scored. Yep. 1 nil to the black..... and red not white!!! WTF. OMG. The Clams were stunned but the QP support weren't!! 

We passed and moved. Moved and passed. Coogee didn't know what to do. 

Until 25 minutes in the Clams woke up. With the sun and wind in Lydia's eyes popped in an equaliser through Lydia's trusty hands. 1-1. D'oh.

With an even battle thereon, we had chances but so did the Clams. A crunching tackle from Birthday girl "saving Grace" was outstanding. Penalty I hear the skanky Clams...no whistle but a big chuckle from me on the sidelines. A little bit of luck on our side? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

We pushed through the middle and had many chances on target but resident Clam keeper kept us at bay.

Half-time whistle blew and we re-grouped. Saving Grace had to dash and Jen had befriended the public toilet (Luke didn't want to use the toilet), eek!! Down to 11 for the start, Porkies had a side cross-wind behind them and hungry for revenge....Porkies revenge!

We had chances and so did they.

With a middle patch of scrappy play Coogee turned it on but never threatened until 25 minutes in. They scored a second. 2-1. Devo. Stunned. Sophia was still asleep, Andre was still kicking our spare match ball away from the half-way line, oh and weeing up against posts. He loves weeing. 2-1 to the Clams.

The Porkies switched on a few minutes later and found composure. Jen had hobbled out from her second home and was up for it! With a handful of corners awarded to us, The Porkies were pressing. Hungry. Our snouts were getting a little cold as the sun dropped but we couldn't leave the Clams ahead.

and then....

....well

...surely not?

Yep.

We equalised.

I say we, it was Alma, the fastest Barista in the West(ern world). 

Goal of the season. Incredibly sweet hit. 40 or so yards out on the left. It strangely reminded me of a goal which an Irish Dunbar player scored against us to win the Championship league. 

This time it was us. 

Boom. Accurately curled into the roof of the net over the capable keepers Clammy hands. 2-2. Yep. Sophia was almost awake. Andre was still weeing and Luke/Liam had been taken home cause they'd run out of clothes.

OMG. 5 minutes to go and we'd equalised. All season teams had scored last minute winners...and  Coogee had equalised in the last two games but this time it was us. Yep. Us. Us. Yep. Us. Yep. Us.

Magical.

UNSW have nipped back into fourth after beating the Bra. With three games left, we need to take (I think) at least 4 points to take fourth spot.

It's tight.

It's exciting.

It's on.

Until next time my loyal globe trotters.

Laters,
Dougal / Couch / Trigg. :)

<h4><a name="match-12"></a> [ 2015 Jul 19]</h4>
Hi All,

Sorry for not getting the match report out last night, the excitement during the game and watching Dunbar v UNSW after our game just took its toll. I was asleep by 8pm on the "couch".

"Excitement?" I hear you say near, far and wide....

Well settle in Porkies and I think I might just tell you.....

David Phillips the venue. 1pm KO. The sun was shining and 11 (7 away!!) lean mean grilling Porky machines were ready for battle!

The ref didn't show but a bearded hipster did and what a hipster he was. He thanked me at the beginning of the game and after. Admittedly I presented him with a cold Coopers Green at the end but he seriously deserved it. He da man!!

UNSW had beaten second place Coogee 1 nil last week and taken our fourth spot. We had to win. We needed three points. Our throats were dry and nerves were kicking in...why? Cause we care!!!!!

The stadium was poised. The kids were pumped (not asleep at lunchtime?) and the bearded hipster ref got the game under way. 

UNSW came out with a bang. Luckily not hitting the back of the net, got two corners in the space of 5 minutes. We couldn't get out of our half. Was it going to be one of those days? None of us knew.

7 and half minutes on my new touch screen watch ($9.99 from San Sebastian!), our throats had cleared and the day changed for the Red & Black for the rest of the day.

We started creating real chances....a shot over the bar and a few at the keeper Brooke opened the account from a cross. BANG! 1 nil. UNSW were stunned. The hipster ref was impressed. 

5 minutes later. Bang. Lisa scores from the left. 2 nil. What? The Porkies were quietly motoring. Like a Lexus in cruise control. 
UNSW were being left for dust. With an abundance of 18 year old students being pulled on and off, UNSW were struggling to break our play. Sophia and Andre were sensing they were about to get my undivided attention on the sidelines. Yes, I was beginning to relax and listening to the chants of "I'm hungry" from gup-a and gup-b.

And booooooooom! The hipster ref awarded us a free kick on the edge of the area. Alma stepped up and most of the Porkies walked away before it was taken (?)....I think for some reason we presumed Alma was going to score. The Porkies guessed right. Boom!! Curled over the wall from the right and into the left top corner. All three goals were impressive and unique. The hipster blew for half time and the Porkies were 3 nil up.

Were there more goals to come? But from which team?.... 

With a few "individual" tips from me, the Porkies trotted out from the shade and into the sun. 

The afternoon turned out to be simply "magical", as Sophia likes to put it.

Welsh troll, Dunbar 1st team coach turned up with his team and brought along Dunbar second team coach (Who's also Welsh, good gracious). Sadly I had to talk to him. I congratulated him on winning the State Cup but didn't fail to mention Brookvale hadn't entered - the very team we lost to in the semi-finals last year. 

"You're 3 nil up today", he sings. 
"you're battling for fourth spot with UNSW I see", he sings again. 

His detailed knowledge our team is worryingly accurate. He stalked us in Div 1 and now in Div 2. Eek. Thankfully my son was peeing on the hockey pitch next door (yep, there was a hockey match going on) so I luckily escaped before he rattled off more personal stats of my old and new team. Is he really on the ESFA board?

Once Andre's wet pants and trousers were off, Alma opened the account for the second half (very considerate I din;t miss the goal!). 4 nil. Or 1 nil second half. This was truly fantastic. The students were baffled. 

But our scoring didn't stop there. Not only did we score from a corner taken by Alma but Tess' header into the back of the net was AMAZEBALLS!!!!!! The net rippled with power. Andre's trousers were still off, Sophia in stitches with Leaping Luke-walker and Liam-wanting-to-leap!!!! 5 nil. What on earth?

The Dunbar trolls were startled. 

Our attacking midfielders and forwards pressed with many more goal scoring opportunities. Seriously. Lydia rattling the cross bar and bouncing over the line (where's our goal-line technology?!) had a few more chances but finally got a penalty awarded for a wayward tackle in the area. Stepping up, slotted in the 6th and final goal for the Porkies!

Every goal was different and every goal was "magical". 6 nil. Outstanding.

Once our song resonated around David Phillips, the Porkies settled down with a case of beer (supplied by UNSW' economics lecturer) on the sidelines and watched Dunbar take on UNSW. Who did we support I hear you all ask? hehe. 

t'was a great game. UNSW scored a quick opener! Dunbar pressed with a very quick forward making most of the chances. Dunbar equalised. Can't remember if Dunbar scored before half-time but myself and kids provided some entertainment on the pitch. Sophia lying down. Andre doing handstands and Luke refusing to leave the field. Grace then followed up with a kick of the match ball at a Dunbar defenders head. Wow. If looks could kill. 

Anyway I continued to eat salt & vinegar crisps off David Phillips' astroturf (I love the turf that much!), more beers were sunk, the kids provided more entertainment and what made the Porkies day and got the loudest roar, was when UNSW scored and equalised in the dying minutes!!!! 

The Welsh troll(s) had been silenced and the Red & Black had an extra curl in their tails!

A day we'll not forget. 

See you all Tuesday night for training Porkies!
Laters,
Dougal / Couch / Trigg. :)
PS Here's Alama's free-kick I "just" caught on my phone.

		G'day,

First up, I'd like to say a big Happy Birthday to Sophia our little ginga ninja - 5 today which also matched the temperature this morning. 5 dedicated years on the sideline, she is 100% committed, without much choice!

Anyway, to the game.

Wentworth Park Stadium. Yep stadium. The Porkies had on-site parking, changing rooms and a glorious pitch, half surrounded by stadium. We'd made it. Not knowing if it was because of our thunderous 7 nil win last week, the Porkies were feeling spoilt. Splendid.

Once the hooves had defrosted our and the kids had a little more colour in their cheeks, the Porkies leapt out of the blocks sharply and started the game professionally. Undefeated Dunbar, donning the usual blue and pink were a little startled. Pressing their defence had a handful of chances. Their keeper was under pressure and struggled to clear many times.

With only one slight blip by us with Dunbar having an indirect free-kick inside our area, had only taken one other shot on target but even this had no menace.

Must admit, I'm not sure how we didn't take the lead by half-time but Dunbar sheepishly left the field when the whistle blew and were not looking like minor-league winners.

With many positives to discuss at half-time, the Porkies were even more charged for the second half. Oh yes.

Possession was plentiful and attacking moves ever so convincing. 

20 minutes in we had the first greatest chance of the day. Lisa O was fed a fantastic ball through Dunbar's centre of defence. Taking it in her stride had a defender close behind and faced a charging keeper ahead! Lisa calmly side-stepped and pushed the ball past their keeper.... into the penalty area Lisa  trotted.....she was through....an empty goal.....but in charges the ex-championship Swedish defender, Lisa and BANG!!!! In flies the arm / elbow and sends Lisa O flying. Yep flying. If Lisa had wings, she would have landed on Anzac bridge. Seriously. With the ball still rolling Lisa was down but the rest of the Porkies, kids and support were up in arms!!!! Yet again jewellery-hungry Ref Mr.gobbledy-magpie-geek (I can say geek cause I'm a trained one, oh and magpie cause he pecks at all things shiny) was here to spoil our day. 

Play-on, he squawks. 

Play-on?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I felt sick. I felt physically sick. Was it the pressure's of managing players, supporters and children week in week out for over 7 years (Note: children came into the scene 5 years ago). No it was yet again the man dressed in black with the authority (apparently) to not make a, what we thought, was a sensible decision!!!

I give up.

The game changed. The Porkies hooves were not connecting. We lost our sparkle and the Dunbar girls knew it too. They pressed for the next 15 minutes and turned our very own spit. 

BTW, I've forgotten to mention the jewellery fiasco with Lydia - we had to play with 10 players until an earring was taken out, as kindly pointed out by a Dunbar player. Mr.gobbeldy-magpie-geek (I can still say geek cause I'm still a trained one) was furious. Raging.

Anyway my Porkies far and wide Dunabr scored. Yep. They scored. 1 nil with 10 minutes to go. 

We pressed for the last 5 or so minutes, with a free-kick on the edge of the area being our finest chance but it was too late.

Admittedly Dunbar have this solid quality where defeat is just not an option for them and today I believe Championship league team Dunbar became State Cup champions - the first time an Eastern Suburbs has won since the State Cup began.

With a long chat Mr.Gobbeldy-magpie-geek and myself at the end, Sophia had a big Happy Birthday song sang. Fleeing the NSW nest ex-porky "Cazablanket" supplied rainbow Birthday cake so we chomped on much needed sugar. Yum.

With a win by UNSW over Coogee today means we have to beat UNSW next Sunday to get a top four finish to show this league what we're made of. 

Game on my lean mean rindless bacon machines!!!

See you all training.

Laters,
Dougal / Couch / Trigg. :)
PS Thanks for my Birthday cake too Caz; I couldn't quite hold out in eating it on the 16th July 'cause, well, it tastes truly amazing. Best of luck with your new life in Perth. X
<h4><a name="match-13"></a> [ 2015 Jun 28]</h4>
To all the Porkies friends who love the world game and love the red and black!

The Women's world cup has captured the nation and captivated the world and so have the Porkies!!

What a day of football.

The bad news:
Matildas out
Canada out

The good news:
England in and the Porkies are still in the running for a top four finish!

t'was another warm Winter's day. Love this country. Sadly the ref packed his bags and left the ground.....just before our game was due to start. Oh no!!! We'd not had a ref allocated for a game in many many years!!....with a drop of sweat rolling down the Guppy brow, had a bad feeling I was going to have to ref. With two kids, many supporters, subs and a team to coach I really didn't want to. Really didn't.

(insert third person dialogue)
Can we share the referring, Dougal asks Pheonix nights lookalike Dunbar coach. 

"Sorry mate I can't run so you'll have to ref both halves".....there's an awkward silence. There was. Inspirational I thought. A women's coach, who coaches a team of apt girls and he can't run. Inspirational. Anyway Dougal replies (looking away) politely with, "sure, I'll do it". What a lazy half-wit.

Anyhoo, laying the laws on the outfield, looking at many ex-first division players, was not happy not being able to coach. Not. He t'wasn't. t'wasn't he was not.

Off the Porkies went. Passing fluid and chances came quick. Admittedly Dunbar were calm and patient except for their keeper. What a mouth. Dougal put in a few sprints towards the Dunbar keeper to explain the need for calm and to not challenge his decisions. Dougal was liking the authority.

Sadly, out of the blue (btw is a fantastic fish and chip shop on Clovelly road serving award winning chicken / fish / beef burgers with homemade chilli mayo!) Dunbar flashed down the right and shot for goal. Brooke put in a fine save, palming it onto the ex-QP div 2 (2007) Anabelle and she "hipped" it in!! 1 nil down against play. How very dare they.

Shortly after our fourth or fifth corner, Tess took a golden chance from the edge of the area and scored!!!!!!!! 1 -1. Dougal nearly got in the way, almost tempted to strike but leapt to safety. We were a well deserved 1-1. Top of the league Dunbar were doub
ting themselves. The mighty Pigs were in control and were upsetting the white, blue....and pink? Yeh I know.

Dougal blew for half time, bang on 45 minutes. Yep. Bang on. How efficient.

With 45 minutes of "couch" advice locked in whilst refereeing, walked through many positives and sharpened the edges.

Pigs came out exceptionally strong. 

Chances came a plenty. A notable move down the right with an exceptional cross into Alma. A chance missed but we were making them and Dunbar weren't.

....and then there it was. 

A delightful ball, just in behind Lisa, the Swedish Dunbar defender ex-div 1, into the path of Super-barista Alma. 

Did the R & B take the lead? 

HELL YEH!!!! 2-1 up. Dougal the ref professionally punched the air, silently cheered and of course was professionally pleased Dunbar were down.....but were they out?

With 5 minutes to go, R&B and Dunbar clashed. The tempo was high and the pace was quick. Dunbar pressed and R&B were under the pump.

Dunbar were awarded a corner. Cleared out to the side, crossed it back in first time. Ball again cleared but this time out to the edge of the area and bang! Goal. Really? Yep. 2-2. Dunbar had equalised. Dougal nearly swallowed his whistle.

With 2 minutes to play of 90 minutes, the R&B legs looked wobbly. The voices were croaky. The supporters were stunned. Sophia called something to Dougal. Not sure what it was. Maybe it was to call the game and hit the playground. Maybe it was to make a sub. Maybe it was to hit the pub?...whatever it was R&B lost the ball in the middle of the Heffron 55 and Dunbar pressed forward. \

Goal. 

Really? Yep. 90 minutes on the clock and Dunbar scored an undeserved winner. The Dougal brow was sweating heavily. Sophia had given up shouting across the pitch. Ouch. The game was gone.

A little drama continued. Sadly R&B didn't score but the "I'm-Not-A-Running-man" Dunbar coach got a little nervous about the time left. "How much time left ref"....this was not the first time I was asked. Dougal stubbornly replied "don't ask me this question (didn't add mate to the end cause he's not my mate)". "How much time?"....he asks again....Dougal sprinting over to the side, asked the coach to be quiet. Love it. Oh the authority.

Dougal ran the game for an extra 5 minutes, hehe, but sadly the whistle blew and the R&B had lost. Poo.

[end of third person dialogue]

It was a proud day for the Porkies, taking unbeaten Dunbar to the wire. Set pieces still posing a problem for us, know there's a few small areas to work on but our quality is shining bright in this league!!!

With a little commotion after the game with me and the coach (standard post match procedure) and net take down (really do not like taking down the nets!) forgot to announce Porky of the week from two weeks ago against Coogee (game last week was rained off). 

Points were evenly spread but joint winners were ....."Brooke and Alma!!!". Alma, if you could bring the beloved Porky along to training, would be great for Brooke to look after for the week.

That aside, here are some result stats:

Round 1: 
1 win
4 losses

Round 2 summary:
2 wins
2 losses
1 draw

Round 3:
1 draw 
 
C'mon Porkies the only way is up!!!! Rest up and look forward to World Cup training on Tuesday night.

Laters,
Dougal / Couch / Trigg. :)
<h4><a name="match-13"></a> [ 2015 Jun 21]</h4>
Dear piglets,

11am KO - why can't we play at this time every week? 

The sun was warm enough to thaw the aching joints and the kids were winding down for a lunchtime nap. Bliss.

The venue on the other hand was Coral Sea 1. Yuck. 

The place holds many unhappy memories for the Porkies. Tears have been shed, punches have been thrown against supporters (true!) and season clinching games have been lost. 

What did today hold for the Red & Black?...well read on for a Sunday Roast special!!!!!!!!

Gazing across the paddock, there were only 9 Green and Gold lined up. Interesting. Coaches #1 put her hand for first half goals whilst I fired up the Pigs with a pre-match talk. Were we ready? Of course!!!

The 9 Bras, as predicted, played like 18. Outstanding. With (growing) solid possession from us, the Bra were blocking all of our chances. Their keeper was strong. Although demanding instructions by Sophia to sit next to her, I cunningly negotiated a good chunk of time to keep up the intensity.

But wait, 3 more Gold and Green appeared after 15 minutes in. It was still 0 -0. What had happened? Had we missed our chance to punish? Did we panic? Did we fret? 

2 Gold and Green trotted on to make the 11 and the account opened for.....

US!!!! (not short for USA btw, but best of luck on Monday morning!)

The foundation was laid, our trotters were crispy and ready to punish!

And punish we did!!  

Coach's #1 took off the gloves and sat down and watched in her goal.

We thumped in 1...
.......2, 

........3

.........4, 

and then 5 goals before half-time! Yep 5. Never? Yep 5. How? 3 goals were scored by Sweden's finest Barista, Alma. Coral Sea's net was on fire for the first time in the history of Porkies visits to the Ghetto. Lydia stepped up for the "attacking midfield" and scored. Also creating another chance by stepping round the keeper but fizzed it past the far post. Defence wanted a piece too!! Banana-lana pushed up with play starting from the back. From defence into attack. Very apt. Yep. With encouragement from the sidelines, Queensland's top-scorer, placed one into the corner. 5 nil. Yep 5 nil at half time and the Pigs had controlled the Bra's ill-filled Coral Sea sandy soil.

Second half was even better. Keep fill in Professor Nicci touched it once, maybe twice, possibly thrice but we dominated. The Bra keeper certainly got her monies worth. Her gloves were wearing thin. 

"Stop her from kicking the ball" shouted the opposition. Who were they referring to?...we'll come back to that.

VJJ left back was released and given her freedom up front. Freeeeeeeeeedom she screamed!!!! With plenty of shots couldn't quite beat the "warmed up" keeper. 

The Bra were referring to Carrot & Swede Alma. They could stop her. Firming up our lead even more fired in 2 extras, one of which was scintillating. We were 7 nil and looking like we were going to score more. Yep. Claire fizzed one over, VJJ fizzed one wide, Coach's #1 dropped the toe and drilled one too. A delightful display in "our" pen.

The Gold and Green, had turned to Mustard and Bogey and the Red and Black were just Mighty including our fantastic new Hoodies , see attached (thanks Claire for organising!!!! Holly, what's your address? we'll post yours!!!)

But wait, was that it 7 nil? More goals to come? Our youthful ref, blew his whistle for a .......penalty!!!! Yep. We were awarded a penalty. VJJ stepped up. With a jiggle to the left and right she sprinted to the ball. BANG!!! RATTLE!!! WOBBLE!!! FOLLOW UP!! .....oh no!!! It looked like it hit the underside of the bar and net rattled and flexed. It did? The supporters went mad!! I ran on the pitch and squared up to the Ref and punches were thrown and...and.and..and...

JUST JOKING (as Sophia loves to say at the minute!).

This did happen the first year I coached though when we were 6 nil down and a goal was disallowed. Dunbar's coach ran on the field and squared up to our fill-in ref. Yep. Dunbar coach lost his license to coach.

AND SO THAT WAS THAT. THE WHISTLE BLEW AND THE PORKIES HAD WON 7 - 0.

All of those bad memories had been put to bed and those nets may never be used again since there were that many scorching goals which pierced the net. ..hey and I would never be one to over dramatise!!!!!!

Laters,
Dougal / Couch / Trigg. :)
