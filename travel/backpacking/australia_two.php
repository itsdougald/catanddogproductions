			<h1>World Travels: Final Leg</h1>
			<p>
			FInally onto our final part of our world travels. Hitting the Middle East, Asia and now
			Australia we'd covered a lot of ground! Our travels ended in June 2005 but I must admit
			it still feels like we're on holiday, even 15 months later since living in Aus!

			....beautiful one day perfect the next.
			</p>
			<p>
 			This is Queensland's slogan and pretty well much justifies it in one
			sentence!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Queensland being our last area to visit and lasting just over 4 weeks has
			come to a memorable end. Queensland has offered us much variety and we've
			covered so much land! Unfortunately now, our backpacks are seeking semi
			retirement but also With over 3 months travelling under our belts, the bank
 			manager has drawn our travels to a sharp close, demanding working life to
			commence, bugger!
			</p>
			<p>
			As I wrote in my last email we had just arrived in Noosa on the southern
			coastal part of Queensland, Australia. To give you an idea of the size of
			Queensland, it bodes over 1000km of coastline and we pretty well much
			covered it all overland! Again as I previously wrote we hit Brisbane then
			onto Surfers paradise and down to Byron Bay for ANZAC weekend (New South
			Wales). We ventured back up to Brisbane then onto Noosa, on the "Sunshine
			coast", 100km up the east coast. Noosa is a quiet beach town exuding wealth
 			and beauty. Our hostel was near Sunshine beach and only an hours walk
			through a National Park to Noosa main beach. With my second pair of newly
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/257050738/" target="new" title="Noosa">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/108/257050738_727e4151cf_m.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="180" alt="PICT0317" /></a>
			bought "boardies" we hit both beaches every day for the three days we were
			there. Sunshine beach was not for the faint hearted. With tumbling waves,
			renowned for great surf and frequent rip tides it felt pretty hairy
			venturing into the sea. But, as we were now newly trained body surfers by
			Big A in Byron Bay we took to the waves like a Guppy to hot tropical
			waters. With the occasional swallowing of densely salted water, the art of catching
 			tube waves was beginning to be mastered, but as Big A always said, "look
			for the back door mate!!"...meaning if there's one big wave coming there's
			another big f*ck off wave behind it - beauty mate, beauty!!!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We took it easy in Noosa. The first night we ate some long awaited Thai
			food - it was good to eat phad Thai noodles again, a definite reminder of our
			travels in Thailand! We managed to catch a film too - "Hitch Hikers Guide
			to the Galaxy" - good to see the Brits are still making first class films,
			speaking of films I forgot to mention in my last email we saw a film for
			free called "The Extra" in Byron Bay. Jimeoine was the main act but also
			wrote it. He's Irish but been living in Aus for over 30 years. The film was
 			superb but what made it was his guest appearance, nice touch! He was
			promoting his film but he did a 20 minute stand up show before the film and
 			was quite funny, boy have we seen a few comedians since being in Aus. On
			our final night in Noosa, we hit an RSL - Return to Service League gentleman's
			club. It's a subsidised club for ex army officers but as a British citizen
			we can get in too, beauty! I got my chops round yet another succulent Rump
			steak, washed down by Aussie's finest lagers but we thought we'd treat
			ourselves to a night on the "Pokies"!! After a little success in
			Campbelltown and Byron Bay (well Big A found A$25 in a pokie tray) we were
			confident....how wrong us gamblers can be! Luckily there were two old
			Aussies playing too and got chatting. One guy had said he'd travelled
			Europe and met many locals who'd bought him drinks and lent him money along the
			way, so he kindly said he'd return the favour via us - he got his mate to
			buy a drink and give us a $1 to play on the pokies, ha ha, good work!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			After a relaxing time in Noosa we headed up the ever lasting Queensland
			coast to Hervey Bay. It was here that we were going to do a 2 day organised
 			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258130217/" target="new" title="Fraser Island: largest sand island in the world.">
 			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/103/258130217_c8adb936c3_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00870" /></a>
 			adventure to Fraser island, the largest sand island in the world and
			inhabits 100% Dingo's. After 11 hours on an overnight coach we checked into
 			the "Friendly Hostel" and boy was it friendly. In fact, from this hostel
			onwards and up the Queensland coast, our accommodation got cleaner and
			friendlier all for a good price. The friendly hostel was more like the
			homely hostel. With a communal kitchen for only 4 people (most hostels
			share kitchens for over 20!) and a balcony to lounge around and a barbie to use
			we didn't want to leave. But, with our trip booked for an early start the
			following morning we packed an overnight bag, left our backpacks in storage
 			and ventured across to Fraser Island for what turned out to be a fantastic
			adventure but also there were three new additions to our tour up
			Queensland's stunning coast!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			With around 25 people on a 4WD coach we cruised around Fraser Island.
			Mostly travelling along the coastal beach we saw over three types of Rain forest,
			three ranges of fresh water lagoons, two dingos and one flat tyre. The
			first day was a whole day and gradually as a group we were all getting on well.
			By the end of the day we'd befriended two great Danes called Trina and Benetta
 			and a Swiss called Andrea - these were later to be our three new additions
			- they were later known as Snuffle puff, bagpuss and fun time Franky! Staying
 			overnight we thought we were going to experience our first dormitory share
			- but low and behold me and V were alone! A flooding toilet was a little
			inconvenient but every dorm had one, but I think I won the award for
			flooding the dorm the most. For some reason after a long morning in the
			shower the toilet had a mind of it's own and spilled itself not only onto
			the bathroom floor but also into our dorm - boy it was like watching a
			tubular wave crash into Byron Bay!!! Luckily our clothes were out of reach.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Our second day on Fraser Island was just as fun and Gregg, our tour leader
			was inundating us with fascinating facts about coastal erosion to
			confirming daddy long legs carries the deadliest poison - he was quite funny and had a
 			reputation taming the girls! Our two day adventure went quickly but we were
 			returned to our friendly hostel, great door to door service. We arranged to
			meet later that night in a pub with the two great Danes and three Swiss. In
 			fact Gregg, his young girlfriend, his sister and brother in law came along
			too - schooners of beer, wine and Bundaberg were consumed but what we later
 			found out was that all but two of the Swiss were travelling up to the same
			destination along Queensland - Airlie Beach.
 			</p>
 			<p>
 			We travelled overnight for 12 hours up the Queensland coast, further
			towards the tropic of Capricorn. The great Danes were on our coach and the Swiss,
			fun time Frankie, on another coach, arrived roughly the same time as us. We
			booked ourselves a triple room at "Bush Village" hostel, a 10 minute walk
			from Airlie town centre, whilst the great Danes were elsewhere. The reason
			for going to Airlie beach was to sail round the Whitsunday Islands, luckily
 			</p>
 			<p>
 			Friendly Hostel were exceptionally helpful and had booked us on a three
			night sail on a Japanese  Pearl lugger owned by Captain Sparrow and his
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258150217/" target="new" title="Fraser Island gang!">

 			Japanese girlfriend Machi. What was amazing was that this sailing boat was
			their home so we felt privileged to be invited on board!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The trip started the day before lady V's birthday and knew it was a perfect
			way to spend it, albeit away from her "other half" (twin sis), family and
			friends back home. The boat housed 8 people and the beds were all in a
			tight compact cabin underneath the deck. In fact, there were only seven which
			meant more food to go round, all of which was deliciously prepared and
			cooked by Machi. There were three 18 year old lads from Brighton called
			Dan, Matt and Alex and a couple from Watford called Dean and Emma. By the end of
 			the trip Matt was called "the shark tamer" and Dean "Mr.U-bend", both I'll
			explain later, ha ha. The sea was a little rough the first day and sailing
			out to the Islands was an experience. With me going a little green and Lady
 			V nearly going overboard we made it to our first rest spot for the night - a
			quiet secluded bay. As we came off the choppy waters we saw two dolphins
			leisurely swimming away, a fantastic start to a memorable trip. Captain
			Sparrow calmly anchored us in, fired the barbie and cooked us our first bit
 			of kangaroo - beauty!! Machi prepared salads, pasta etc to accompany
			Australia's national tasty delicacy. Whilst they cooked we had our first
			experience of fishing - embarrassingly we didn't even get a bight - in
			fact, it was only the "kids" from Brighton that did catch any. Matt managed to
			catch a baby shark, hence his nickname.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The first night Sparrow recommended me and V slept up on deck as he feared
			the weather may turn for the worst. So we did..but boy was that a mistake.
			Cramped up in our sleeping bags the rain decidedly came thrashing down all
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258320453/" target="new" title="Machi and Captain Sparrow at the helm!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/86/258320453_a9a5344e19_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00924" /></a>
			night! Although we were under canvas the rain still blew in from the sides
			- we got about two hours sleep along with a small cold and wet sleeping
			bags!! But at least we braved the whole night and waking up on deck for lady V's
			birthday was an achievement! I'd also arranged with Machi a birthday cake
			to be presented but also told Machi about lady V's infatuation with her yellow
 			herbal friends, bananas - all of which were finely delivered in the evening
			at the end of perfect day!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The sun was blazing and myself and captain Sparrow up-anchored and the Ise
			Pearl sailed the Pacific Ocean purely by it's sails, beauty! As the sails
			went up so I serenaded to the rest of the boat, singing Enya "Sail away,
			sail away.." and David Grey "Sail away with me honey..." I was not overly
			popular with lady V or the rest of the boat members, but at least captain
			Sparrow and Machi appreciated it, I think! We anchored at another bay and
			was time to do some snorkeling. Because the islands were populated by
			thousands of jelly fish we had to wear "stinger suits" - this covered us
			head to toe in black rubber - kinky! This was our first experience of the
			Barrier Reef - the coral was so bright and the fish so colourful. We were
			on the hunt for reef shark and turtles but to no avail but boy did we see some
 			large fish!! I also managed to feed pita bread to a few large fish hanging
			around the boat (from my mouth) whilst this was going on Machi had prepared
			lunch fit for a king - we were about to eat the best food for three days!!
			We celebrated lady V's birthday at night - with plenty of wine and beer
			we'd bought before we got onto the ship there was no shortage. Lady V was
			presented with a cake after dinner but unfortunately everyone had eaten so
			much dinner (banana in lady V's case) we couldn't manage a single slice.
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258337930/" target="new" title="Ise Pearl crew.">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/82/258337930_8e9e9c49c9_m.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00955" /></a>
			Luckily the cake was small and I'm sure Captain Sparrow took great delight
			in eating it. We played cards along with drinking forfeits all night in the
 			cabin as it was heavy winds and rain outside and we didn't make the same
			mistake of sleeping up on deck, although being so crampt in the cabin we
			all had sore heads in the morning but not just from the drink, ouch!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			The following day was again perfect sunshine, although further out to sea
			Captain Sparrow had said it was too rough for his ship to sail around to
			whitehaven beach, apparently a stunning beach which is where most modern
			ship sail to. We were a little disappointed but we were still lucky to be
			on the best looking ship in the Whitsundays! We did more snorkeling and I was
			lucky to swim with a huge turtle. Alex had spotted him and tried to call
			everyone over but only myself and Mr.U-bend heard! Speaking of Mr.U-bend,
			he got this name by confessing his regular experience of having to unblock
			"things" from the u-bend of his toilet as well as the one on the Ise
			Pearl...Anyway, the turtle was swimming near the surface and coming up for
			air. He reared his prehistoric head, took two breaths and dived back down.
			As he dove we stroked his shell and felt his flippers. Amazing. Sparrow
			boated us all over to a small secluded beach (I think so Machi and Sparrow
			could have some time alone). We had a frisbee, football and American
			football to keep ourselves amused for a few hours, so we were all happy. As
 			dusk fell, so we experienced the sun set over the horizon. We were lucky
			enough to experience this twice in a row - unbelievable. Sparrow told us to
 			look out for the green flash of light once the top edge of the sun hit the
			ocean - it was very bright and over in seconds. As the sun did fall, the
			ocean below came to life. As I mentioned before the Brighton lads were
			successful in fishing. They were catching huge fish but the minute, but it
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258330765/" target="new" title="What a catch: baby shark!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/113/258330765_7eaf48e2b9_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00934" /></a>
			was Matt who caught the catch of the day. A 4ft long baby shark. Using only
 			a reel as a fishing rod you could see the power of shark, desperately
			trying to unhook itself. Matt managed to get him up on board and Captain Sparrow
			took over. Most of the fish have to be put back and this shark definitely
			had to be, but with a few proud photos taken and Sparrow chasing us round
			the boat with the shark, he plunged back into the ocean. Perhaps one day
			the shark may get his revenge??...
 			</p>
 			<p>
			After three memorable nights we sailed back to shore and what seemed a long
 			time from mainland Australia! Again we had a rocky return but was fantastic
			to see the waves crashing on board and always looking out for the "back
			door" wave! We returned to Airlie marine at around midday, Machi took a
			group photo and Captain Sparrow took us to shore in his mini-speed
			boat....our sailing days were now over but with whale spotting from June to
 			</p>
			<p>
			October we'd definitely be hitting the Pacific Ocean very soon. We
			celebrated our great trip with a few more beers with Emma and Mr.U-bend
			before we headed back to the hostel, picked up our backpacks and boarded a
			coach, hopefully for the last time, to make our way up to Cairns, a mere 12
 			hours up the road.
 			</p>
			<p>
			We'd allowed ourselves a week in Cairns as so many people had told us there
 			was lots to do and there was, funds permitting. We stayed at Tropic days,
			another fantastic hostel with plenty of entertainment at night. We
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258356171/" target="new" title="Cairns!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/96/258356171_a8aefcf971_m.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC01023" /></a>
			travelled up with the great Danes and fun time Frankie was there waiting for us, so
			again the Fraser Is possy were reunited. We all booked ourselves onto a
			trip up to Cape Tribulation, a 2 hours ride deep into the tropical rain forest.
			We were staying overnight so booked ourselves in for a horse ride through
			forestation and along Cape Tribulation beach, a world heritage protected
			area, the following morning. We visited a bird sanctuary that also had
			kangaroos you could feed and wake up more sleeping koalas. We saw for the
			first time a "flamin gallah", which as we know became a catchphrase used by
 			Alf in Home and Away. It's "flamin" because of gallah's bright pink firey
			belly...so there you go. We also did a trek into another tropical rain
			forest and managed to see a little wildlife (most of the time you're told
			you'll see wildlife on treks or marine life on boat trips but 9/10 times
			you don't!). We saw a token lizard, but no ordinary lizard, a red under bellied
 			snake and er a spider - wow. There was an amazing fresh water river which a
 			few of us did swim in which was a bit scary, especially when it's teaming
			with crocodiles! Speaking of crocodiles, we also had a boat trip along
			Daintree river, renowned for estuarine (meaning sea water meets fresh
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258472891/" target="new" title="So many girls!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/108/258472891_8e786c48db_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC01002" /></a>
			water) crocodiles sleeping along it's muddy banks! We managed to see three. Two on
 			the banks but one which eerily swam alongside our boat with it's jagged
			long nose breaking the surface of the water, keeping a beady eye on the
			intruders. Also along the banks we saw two snakes hanging on branches and a
 			token Kingfisher diving for small fish, so we were quite lucky. At night we
 			stayed at a hostel and we were all sharing a dorm - couldn't complain
			sharing with 4 other girls! We drank lots of beer and played lots of killer
 			pool. The following day we did our horse trek. Now don't get me wrong, this
 			definitely was not my idea but must admit glad I did it. Me and V went in
			as novice riders but came out as race jockeys! 
			Our horses were called Popeye and Gonzo, ha ha, but they were the best of friends; trotting at the back
			they never wanted to leave each others side! V had to use a small stick to
			get Gonzo moving but we had two chances of galloping and boy did they move!
			Again I was surrounded by girls, we were joined by three girls from
			Tunbridge Wells (incidentally knew JP, small world hey) but it was great
			fun. We rode for over 3 hours a late lunch and headed back to Cairns with
			severe saddle sore, ouch!!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We also booked ourselves in for a trip out to the barrier reef. We headed
			out sea on a modern catamaran, not a patch on the Ise pearl but because it
			was only a day trip we needed to get out to sea, fast! The weather turned
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258465857/" target="new" title="Gonzo and Popeye - side by side!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/102/258465857_d27b8b06d5_m.jpg" align="left" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC00992" /></a>
			out to be superb. Cairns was now, peak season, albeit their winter but it
			was a clear 29 degrees, beauty mate! It had been raining a little on and
			off but our last three days in Cairns were glorious sunshine, a perfect way to
			end our travels. We did our snorkeling, whilst others were diving -
			apparently it's safer to dive if there are sharks around as if you're
			splashing around the surface the shark may think you're a juicy sea lion
			and go in for the kill!!....with this in mind we still braved it. The various
			colours of fish were fantastic. We saw "Nemo" and his friends, squid,
			stingrays, clams, starfish and much more - stunning. I think we're now
			getting used to the ocean and what a bit more intrigued as to what it has
			to offer so perhaps we'll do a dive at some point but for now we'll stick to
			being shark bate! 
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We spent our remaining days in Cairns relaxing around the public lagoon (no
 			beach) and had our farewell drinks with the great Danes and the Swiss last
			Friday night. We had a flight booked back to Sydney last Saturday and was
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/258396039/" target="new" title="Snorkelling out at the Great Barrier Reef!">
			<img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/116/258396039_bacaaf88e0_m.jpg" align="right" width="240" height="180" alt="DSC01008" /></a>
			sad to leave the glorious sunshine of Queensland and head back to, believe
			it or not, the wet and cold gloom of New South Wales! As we took of we had
			an amazing view of Cairns coastline. With clear blue sky we witnessed
			sunset at 35,000 feet, our travels had now ended after 3 months, boy we've so
			much, but I know this won't be the end of it!!
 			</p>
 			<p>
 			So now our life in Sydney begins.
 			</p>
			<p>
			We headed straight back to lady V's relatives in Campbelltown where we'd
			left half our gear before we went to Queensland. Again eating more tasty
			home cooked food and nearly polishing off my second slab of VB in two days
			we headed for Vaucluse, 20 minutes outside Sydney CBD, to stay with our
			Aussie friend Kim for a week. Our aim was to find a flat in Coogee but as
			we found out yesterday we have managed to find a one bedroom flat to rent
			within a day and a half of looking! The estate agents in Randwick were so
			unhelpful but there was one agent that willingly helped and drove us to
			what will now be our home for the remaining 8 months of our visa!! It's a newly
			built apartment behind shops with a bathroom and integrated kitchen and
			lounge but more importantly it has a balcony, so we can enjoy the warm
			Summer nights sipping our alcoholic refreshments! The rent is half what we
			paid in London but I must admit is probably the most expensive apartment
			per square foot!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We move in on Monday and lady V's nursing starts Tuesday night, so within a
 			week already we'll be slipping back to the grindstone that we all love to
			hate!
 			</p>
