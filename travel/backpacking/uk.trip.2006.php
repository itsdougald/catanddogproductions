	<h2>Happy Holidays!</h2>
	<p>
	Well over three month have passed and it already seems like a lifetime ago we were back on the stony, cobbely shore of the UK in November/December 2006!
	</p>
	<p>
	Being effeciently organised for the first time in our lives, we scripted a very tight schedule for us both to ensure we saw alomst everyone we wanted to see -
	keeping peace between family and friends! Download it <a href="<?echo $EXETEL_HOME ?>/media/Trip.to.uk.xls">here</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	I've not written about our trip in detail, guess mainly because as I've been pinned down further into the working world and the hours of being contracted to work
	limit my free time; the free time that we do have is used up too!
	</p>
	<p>
	I have uploaded photos from our time in Dubai and the UK. If you want to see photos from the dog's stag do click <a href="/wedding/stagdo.php">here</a>
