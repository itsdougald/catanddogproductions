			I hope you're ready for bed, it's time for another long read...

			We left Bangkok last Wednesday @ 7.40pm and caught an overnight train to
			Surat Thami and hopped on a ferry @ 10.30a.m to Koh Samui. We've are still in Koh Samui
			and moved on from North Chaweng yesterday morning and onto the more
			secluded part of Mae Nam.
			</p>
			<p> 
			We were certainly ready to hit a beach destination after four nights in
			Bangkok. It did smell but glad we didn't take anyones advice to get out

			quickly. The days we had were four crazy,
			hedonistic nights! The hostel was in a perfect location, just off Th
			Sukumvidt (where all the expats hang out with their Thai girls. Also near
			the BTS (skyline train) but more importantly near plenty of bars,
			restaurants and fast food stalls on the streets. The fast food consisted
			of pork/chicken on a skew coated in thick sweet Thai sauce. Most roughly
			cost 5Baht (8p) so it was rude not to snack in between meals...all day
			long!!!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Most days were action packed, so was certainly different to our luxurious
			leisurely lifestyle in Dubai, but we were ready for it! The first night we
			hit the local bar just outside our hostel. It was outside so the
			mosquito's had a great feed on our fresh tasty white legs but despite this
			we got chatting to a German dude called Vienna and he introduced us to
			Rob, who had lived in Bangkok for four years but was only on a stop over
			back to New Zealand so Rob told us the do's and don'ts in Bangkok.
 			</p>

			We had a late one but all decided to meet up at 8.30 prompt and catch a
			train to the largest outdoor market in...err..the world...I think. It had
			everything, including live animals, ranging from dogs and pigs to iguana's
			and snkaes...crazy stuff. The noise was immensely dense and a little

			distressing I bet half the animals were chopped and put sold on the fast
			food stalls.....joking!!Apparently there was cockfighting going on
			somewhere in the market. We heard the frantic betting going on but
			couldn't find the fight through the maze of stalls! I bought a token long
			sleeved t-shirt
			from a stall, which required me to show my pasty white chest off to the
			locals and admittedly did draw quite a crowd...in fact I was ready to
			break into my famous caterpillar move, but I denied them the honor....if I
			did they'd probably cage me up, dip me in sweet chili sauce and sell me on
			a fast food stall next to the dog meat!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Other trips around Bangkok included the mandatory trip to the grand Palace
			and lying Buddha . Had a few boat trips up and down the River Chayo (think
			it's called that)...realised this was the cheapest mode of
			<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/catanddog/239208961/" title="Grand Palace" target="new">

			transport...speaking of transport the train was a delight to travel
			on...nicely air-conditioned which is a saint in the blistering heat of
			Bangkok.
			</p>
			<p>
			Caught a few crazy tuk-tuk's through town (three wheeled cars). In fact
			took one to China town by day and the driver said China Town was closed.
			The previous night we'd be conned by a taxi driver that China town was
			closed (which we stupidly believed) and took us to an empty restaurant, so
			we didn't fall for that again. I told the tuk-tuk driver he was a "wan#er"
			with a big smile on my face...luckily he didn't understand and laughed
			back, good lad, ha ha!
 			</p>
			<p>	
			We saw some Thai boxing which was superb! Not as much blood as I thought
			there'd be but there were two complete knockouts with a little blood
			spraying out onto the ringside seats. Most of the
			ringside crowd were Westerner's, obviously like myself, purely because
			they sell the expensive tickets to us first and the locals get the cheaper
			seats behind. There were 10 fights in total and lasted 4 hours so we saw
			plenty of moves to take note but the main event (8th fight) was the best!!
			Most of the stadium was filled with locals betting frantically during the
			fight. They were also allowed to shout advice to the boxer during the
			intervals....superb! The fight consisted of plenty of fist elbow

			combinations and were pretty affective...another useful move for the dark
			streets back in London.
 			</p>
			<p>
			The last night we saw Norah Jones in concert which was expensive and must
			admit was worth it. It was filled with crazy, screaming Thai's shouting
			how much they loved Norah Jones....must admit she did look quite fetching,
			ha ha!
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We hung around on our last day in Bangkok, eating more Pad Thai noodles
			and spicy soup and drinking Singha beer till our train set off in the
			evening down to Suran Thami. The journey was ok, got to sleep in second
			class on a bunk bed for 15GBP each, which is cheap! We hit the ferry port
			and boated across to Koh Samui at 10.30a.m. The sun was shining and we now
			hitting paradise...well sort of.
 			</p>
 			<p>
			We headed straight for North Chaweng, the quieter end of the touristy part
			of Chaweng. The island's around 20km wide so didn't take long to travel on
			an open public bus from east to west. The beach was nice but quite crowded
			with tourists but more annoyingly a stream of locals selling coconuts and
			bangles...get out my face!!!! There was plenty of bars and restaurants to
			hit at night, which was good, but also you could hit the beach at night
			too, which was superb!
 			</p>

			We were stranded in N.Chaweng after a torrential downpour for 24 hours so
			that killed a day, but yesterday we moved onto Mae Nam, where it's a
			little quieter and we're staying back in the hills so have a nice view
			from our balcony....well of coconut trees anyway...there everywhere!!
			Yesterday was another cloudy day so didn't do much other than play free
			pool against a Singaporean dude who normally played snooker and had a
			highest break of 80....I obviously beat him with my silky pool skills, in
			fact even lady V nearly beat him....he offered to make a Singapore sling
			(we were in his bar)...but I thought it was best not....
 			</p>
 			<p>
			Anyway slipped in the tourist lifestyle by doing a half day trip around
			Koh Samui (started early so at least hot us out of bed) but we're planning
			to kayak to Ang Thong tomorrow (where they filmed "the beach") to do some
			snorkeling etc....
 			</p>
			<p>
			So signing off now. We plan to stay in Koh Samui for another two days and
			then fly onto Phuket...life is just so tough...
 			</p>
			<p>Bye for now.
