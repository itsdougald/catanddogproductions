	<h2>UK 2014</h2>
	With a quick visit back to the UK for Duck's 70th Birthday we had 13 days. We had a big welcome party at Heathrow airport on
	Saturday 26th @ 6am! With a big greeting and a coffee we head off to Billericay for a night.

	On Sunday 27th, we drove down to Okehampton in Devon and stayed in the <a href="http://www.manorhousehotel.co.uk/">Manor House</a> for 5 nights with Pops, Duck, 
	Dave, Claire, Henry, Jack, Charlie, Jon, Sinead, Niall, Caoihme, Ronan and Dara brother - there were 17 of us! Mesing around the lawn by day and night, played
	crazy golf, spent plenty of time in the mad house, playing tennis, visted <a href="http://www.visitbude.info/">Bude</a> and <a href="http://www.clovelly.co.uk/">Clovelly</a> 
	(In 1913, beach town in Australia was named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovelly,_New_South_Wales">Clovelly</a>), golf Kigbeare with Bugsy and Jim Jam!.

	Driving into London, Hampton Court, dropped of V and the kids with John/Anna/Bella and Myles whilst The Dog headed back to Billericay to drop the car
	off, eat a Kamble Chinese takeaway and spend a night/day with Pops and Duck! Did I tell you all it took 7 hours to drive from Devon to Hampton Court?
	On the plus side side we got to see Stone Henge from the A303!
	</p>	
	<p>
	Sunday 3rd, John and Anna opened their house up to host a BBQ - friends came and went for the day as we drunk and ate under the scorching
	sun! The girls hit the Prince Of Wales in Hampton Court at night, whilst Johnny cleaned up his house (I entertained the kids).
	Monday 4th, Dog played golf with Ginge at <a href="http://www.burhillgolf-club.co.uk/">Burhill Golf club</a> (Small fact: this is where Barnes Wallis 
	invented the Dambuster bouncing bomb); Jez, who had the runs (another small fact), joined us for a drink at the clubhouse. Later that night 
	Dog and Johnny hit Kingston town for a few bevvies, although we struggeld to get into a nightclub becuase we dind't have ID, not because we look too old (another small fact)! In the afternoon, Cat headed south to Pagham with Kirstin and the kids and 
	joined XCYS and Barometer at the Pagham Caravan site!

	Tuesday 5th, Anna, Johnny and Dog headed down to <a href="http://www.haven.com/parks/sussex/church-farm/">Pagham for some Caravan carniage</a>! With an afternoon BBQ on the go, we basked in the sun
	,enjoyed the kids entertainment by day and the Caravan site's by night. Think the kids picked up a gambling habit on those 2p machines!
